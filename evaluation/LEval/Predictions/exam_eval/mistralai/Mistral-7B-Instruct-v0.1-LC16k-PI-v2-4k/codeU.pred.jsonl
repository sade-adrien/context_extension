The function name is take, so it's clear that the operation being performed is element-wise indexing. Next, go through the comments and look for further instructions or requirements. Look for any input or requirements, and see if there's anything special or unusual about these inputs or requirements.\nWhat are the parameters? And what is the required input for this operation?\nThe required input is the inputs `a`, and `ind`. \nFor the inputs `a` and `ind`, we need to take a given input (`a`) and do element-wise indexing across it. We then take the array `(a[:, ind])` for each input.\nWhat are the requirements for the output?\nThe operation requires an array of shape `(Ni..., Nj...)`.\nWhat are the special requirements or any optional instructions?\nThe operation has no special requirements, but the input shape must not be the same as the input for the `take` function on this input. For example, if a 2-d array is given as input, it must not be a vector.\nWhat is the return type of this function?\nThe return type for this function is a new array with shape `(Ni..., Nj...)` and its dtype is dependent on the indices array.\nWhat is the expected output of this function?\nThe expected output is a new array with shape `(Ni..., Nj...)` and its dtype is dependent on the indices array. It takes the following shape form of input:\n```scss\nif n_dims == 1:\n```a, ind\n```` or\n```a[idx], idx\nif n_dims == 1:\n```[idx], a\n```\nWhat is the input and output format to be used for this function?\nFor this function, the input format is:\n```scss\na = a[idx]\n``` or\n```scss\nn_d[0:1] = N, N = a.shape[0], a = a[idx] for dim = 0 or   . . .   . . .   . .    n_d[i-1] . = N for dim = 1 .  1 . 1  .    n_d[i-1] . = N for dim = 2", "evaluation": "exam"}

How do we get the 2-D shape of the array?
