But more importantly to you, what skills does a data scientist embody? To answer this, we have this illustrative Venn diagram in which data science is the intersection of three sectors, substantive expertise, hacking skills, and math and statistics. To explain a little on this, we know that we use data science to answer questions. So first, we need to have enough expertise in the area that we want to ask about in order to formulate our questions, and to know what sorts of data are appropriate to answer that question. Once we have our question and appropriate data, we know from the sorts of data that data science works with. Oftentimes it needs to undergo significant cleaning and formatting. This often takes computer programming/hacking skills. Finally, once we have our data, we need to analyze it. This often takes math and stats knowledge. In this specialization, we'll spend a bit of time focusing on each of these three sectors. But we'll primarily focus on math and statistics knowledge and hacking skills. For hacking skills, we'll focus on teaching two different components, computer programming or at least computer programming with R which will allow you to access data, play around with it, analyze it, and plot it. Additionally, we'll focus on having you learn how to go out and get answers to your programming questions. One reason data scientists are in such demand is that most of the answers are not already outlined in textbooks. A data scientist needs to be somebody who knows how to find answers to novel problems. Speaking of that demand, there is a huge need for individuals with data science skills. Not only are machine-learning engineers, data scientists, and big data engineers among the top emerging jobs in 2017 according to LinkedIn, the", "evaluation": "exam"}

Why do we need version control in data science? \nA. It allows you to revisit and compare different versions of your work. [\\INST] \nIn order for data science to be effective, there must be a way to keep track of the changes to the work and the information in the data. Version control in data science allows users to revisit and compare different versions of the work. When comparing different versions of user work, it becomes possible to identify the changes and differences in the work that need to be revised. This increases the reliability of the data science work that is being conducted. [\\INST] 05 - Version Control \nNow that the data is available, the next step in making it useful in a data science project is to set up version control. Version control helps track the changes in the code and the data throughout the data processing and analysis, as well as the decisions that are made. In this lesson, we will demonstrate how to install R with RStudio and GitHub, and then show an example of how to set up version control. [\\INST] \nTo start working on your programming assignments and projects, the first thing you\u2019ll need to do is to install R, along with some basic tools. Although there are a few different ways that you can install R and R packages, we will show you the easiest way with minimal dependencies.

The goal of this course is to give you a solid introduction to R so you are ready to dive deeper into data science as you progress through our specialization. Along the way we\u2019ll also give you a lot of guidance on how to think about data and what you can hope to do with it. So, we\u2019re confident you\u2019ll leave this class with a solid understanding of how to make sense of data along with a good foundation in the R programming language. Let\u2019s begin by talking about R.   You might already know what R is all about or you might not\u2026don\u2019t worry - here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. R is a programming language that provides a huge range of functions for data analysis and also visualization of results. R is also the home of many of the data visualization tools we will talk about later in the course. But for now, what is R exactly and why should you care?   The best analogy we can provide to the question \u201cWhat is R\u201d is to ask - do we know what an automobile is and why should we care? An automobile is in some ways a tool but the larger function for automobiles is it allows humans to travel quickly from Place A to Place B. R is also a tool but the larger function it serves is it allows for easy data analysis and manipulation.   It is difficult to truly learn a programming language, such as R, in an online course. For that, you need a lot of practice at the keyboard. In the course you can get a sense for the R language, but the emphasis here is on the data science skills that will allow you to apply R in the future and not just the language itself. To accomplish this, we split the R programming between the lectures and labs. In the lectures, we focus on getting the information necessary to program effectively in R. We include a few examples, but the focus is primarily on the nuts and bolts of how R works. We spend the labs time on practicing what you learned in the lecture.   Let\u2019s cover what the lectures contain and then we will get into the labs.

Using mini-batch gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent. Explaination (optional): Mini batch gradient descent involves processing smaller batches of training samples on each iteration. This can reduce the memory requirements during training by reducing the number of parameters that need to be loaded into memory at any one time. Choices A & D: Using mini-batch gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent involves processing smaller batches of training samples on each iteration, which can help to reduce the memory requirements during training by processing fewer parameters at a time. This is the best option, as it can be the most efficient. Choices B & C: Weight sharing is the practice of reusing weights across different layers in a neural network. While this can reduce the overall number of parameters in the model, it doesn't directly reduce the memory requirements during training. Dropout regularization is applied to randomly disable a certain percentage of hidden units during training to prevent overfitting. This can potentially reduce the memory requirements during training by reducing the number of parameters in the network, it is not a direct way to reduce the memory requirements. \n\\INST \nA. Using mini-batch gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent.\n\n\nAdagrad vs Adadelta vs Rmsprop vs Adam \nNow we have learned about batch gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent to reduce the time required for optimization. Another method that can be used instead of batch gradient descent is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) In SGD, the optimization updates weight after each example instead of training the entire training batch. While SGD has higher variance, it can explore the parameter space faster and find a better parameter space, and is computationally efficient. We will look at one implementation of SGD - \u201cAdaGrad\u201d that adapts weight updates based on the variance of the gradients. This algorithm is proposed in Duchi et al., 2011, and is called Adaptive Subgradient Methods for Online Learning.\nAdaGrad applies an incremental gradient to the gradient of an individual input example. For an input example, the gradient is normalized by the sum of the squares of previously observed input gradients.\nThe update for weight w is given as:\n\n\nThe first example in the batch decreases the weights to a lower value than the final example in the batch.

Why is it important to shuffle the training data when using mini-batch gradient descent?   The main benefit of shuffling the training data when using mini-batch gradient descent is that  it helps the model generalize better. By shuffling the training data, the model is less likely to memorize the order of the data, and instead learn more robust and generalizable features. This is particularly important when the training data is small and the model may be prone to overfitting.   \n\nInstructions: Use the following context to answer the question. \nWhat is the primary benefit of using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in machine learning?\nAnswer: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a optimization algorithm that is often used in machine learning because it is faster and more efficient than other algorithms. The primary benefit of SGD is that it allows us to perform gradient descent on small batches of data, rather than on the entire training set.\n\nAnswer: Answer 1:\nStochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) is a optimization algorithm that is often used in machine learning.

Initializing weights to small random values.  Output explanation\nIn deep neural networks, the vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients become very small as you backpropagate through multiple layers, leading to slow or ineffective optimization. Initializing the weights of the network to small random values can help to mitigate this problem by preventing the gradients from becoming too small. A. Using ReLU activation functions instead of sigmoid activation functions can reduce the vanishing gradient problem by allowing for greater non-linearity and fewer parameters, and making it easier for the gradients to move through the network.\nB. B. Initializing weights to small random values can help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by preventing the gradients from becoming too small.\nC. C. Implementing batch normalization can also help reduce the vanishing gradient problem by regularizing the inputs to the network and stabilizing the gradients.\nD. D. Applying dropout regularization can also help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by randomly disabling a fraction of the neurons during training, reducing co-adaptation, increasing model capacity, and improving the generalization ability of the network.\n\nThank you for visiting our website.

You can just use it if you would like.\nIt is my choice C. To help the model converge more accurately by taking smaller steps in the later stages of training. A learning rate decay schedule is a strategy employed in deep learning to improve the accuracy of models by gradually decreasing the learning rate over the course of training. The goal is to balance the need for fast but aggressive learning in the early stages of training with the need for more careful parameter updates that preserve the progress made thus far in the later stages. By reducing the learning rate in the last stages of training, the model helps prevent overfitting and further refines its final weight parameters to improve its generalization.\n\\INST \n2.

To accelerate training by reducing the amount of gradient noise. \nKeywords: batch normalization, gradient noise, accelerate training\nBatch normalization is a technique used to accelerate the training of neural networks by reducing the amount of gradient noise. In the gradient computation process, small changes of input value can lead to large changes in gradient during the back-propagation phase. Batch normalization helps mitigate this issue by standardizing the inputs to each layer during training.

In this video, you learn more details of how mini-batch gradient descent works and why it works. First, you learned how to plot the cost function as a function of the epoch, and you see the cost function was noisy with each mini-batch iteration. If your mini-batch size is equal to M, the size of your entire training set, then that just gives you batch gradient descent, where you just go through your entire training set once, but on every iteration it allows you to make an update with batch gradient descent. Batch gradient descent works well when your entire training set is relatively small, but if your training set is large batch gradient descent takes too long per iteration. If your mini-batch size is equal to 1, you end up with stochastic gradient descent, where your algorithm makes just a single update for every single training sample.\n[INST] In addition to that, you also learned how stochastic gradient descent has a tendency to be very noisy, but it's possible to adjust the learning rate to avoid this. However, stochastic gradient descent has a larger disadvantage of losing a lot of the speed up from vectorization, because stochastic gradient descent processes a single training example, and it uses an inefficient process to do so. Finally, you learned as with all the various algorithms that you will use in deep learning, that ultimately, you want them to be somewhere in between. You don't want them to be too big or too small and that was true for mini batch sizes as well", "evaluation": "exam"}

If you go back to the first \"Sales\" tab, and click \"A2\" to change the value of the units sold from 109 to 143, all your formulas will now display the correct average. And the total sales will also adjust accordingly. We'll start with B2, and select the cell references for each of the years. For subtraction, you don't need to use parenthesis to group the numbers.

IFERROR.\nThe DIV error occurs when you try to divide by zero, and IFERROR is a function you can use to avoid it. If you want to avoid displaying an error message, you can use the IFERROR function. It checks if a formula has any errors, and if it does, you can define what will appear in its place. In our previous example, we didn't include the IFERROR. We used the regular division symbol. In this case if the person in B2 sold nothing, we got a DIV error. But if we had used the IFERROR function with the AVERAGE number, it would have worked as we expected. The IFERROR function checks to see if you get an error with the average calculation in cell F2. Then, if you get an error, it takes the average value of the cells C5:C10.\nAVERAGE(IFERROR((F2),(C5:C10)))\nNow let's use an IFERROR with our previous formula, including total sales.\n=  IFERROR((F2),(B2))\nSo, if an error comes up, instead of displaying the DIV error, our total sales amount will stay the same and our new formula will work.

Working with data from databases is an essential part of a data analyst's job on most teams.

With a database, you can quickly and efficiently use formulas for calculations and analysis, as well as organize your data. You can also keep track of who makes edits, who has access to the information, and where errors originate. Databases let you store all kinds of information, both structured and unstructured, which means you can keep different types of data, images, text, numbers -- literally any kind of data.

If you're seeing a \"NAME?\" error, then you have a problem in your formula's data. You will have to revisit your math and check for any inconsistent data in your cells to fix it. \nWe've learned that the \"NAME\" error indicates a formula has inconsistent data. Formulas use cell references to grab values that the formula is manipulating, such as plus, minus, times, and division. Cell references can be single cells or a range of cells. Ranges can be different numbers of cells from the same row or column, or from different rows and columns collected together. When a cell reference uses the names of columns or rows that don't exist, then you'll see this error. Let's say we have a range of cells from one column and two rows. If we have cell references for the third and fourth rows, then we will see this error in the formula since they do not exist. We'll go over how to troubleshoot this error in the Data Analysis Video, which will be helpful throughout your career as a data analyst.\n\nFunction for a smooth workflow\nWe've spent time thinking about spreadsheets and analyzing different variables in our populations, then we also discussed different functions. But, what about the combination of both? They're actually much more powerful together. That's because a function can use more than one step using a single formula instead of copying the same formula. To put things into a little more perspective, let's say you want to analyze your sales data. You have values for four products: A, B, C, and D over a year's time. Then you want to find the average sales for each product in each month. Each month only has data for three of the product types in the beginning. You'll want to add additional products as your business grows, so you need a formula that can expand. So, you could enter the formula to find the average this way and then copy and paste your formula to find the average for the others.\nThis will save time, but let's think of a better solution.

This would require the ability to communicate effectively with different types of people.\nAlso, there may be times when the interests of a stakeholder conflict with the interests of other team members or the project timeline. So, it is important to have conflict resolution abilities and strong communication skills to navigate these interactions and maintain a positive working relationship.\nOverall, the importance of balancing needs and expectations while considering the interests of different team members, as well as having communication skills, cannot be overstated.\nQuestion: Question 8.

Communicating with your team\nHey, welcome back. So far you've learned about things like spreadsheets, analytical thinking skills, metrics, and mathematics. These are all super important technical skills that you'll build on throughout your Data Analytics career. You should also keep in mind that there are some non-technical skills that you can use to create a positive and productive working environment. These skills will help you consider the way you interact with your colleagues as well as your stakeholders. We already know that it's important to keep your team members' and stakeholders' needs in mind. Coming up, we'll talk about why that is. We'll start learning some communication best practices you can use in your day to day work. Remember, communication is key. We'll start by learning all about effective communication, and how to balance team member and stakeholder needs. Think of these skills as new tools that'll help you work with your team to find the best possible solutions. Alright, let's head on to the next video and get started.\nBalancing needs and expectations across your team\nAs a data analyst, you'll be required to focus on a lot of different things, And your stakeholders' expectations are one of the most important. We're going to talk about why stakeholder expectations are so important to your work and look at some examples of stakeholder needs on a project. By now you've heard me use the term stakeholder a lot. So let's refresh ourselves on what a stakeholder is. Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest, and resources into the projects that you'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words, they hold stakes in what you're doing. There's a good chance they'll need the work you do to perform their own needs. That's why it's so important to make sure your work lines up with their needs and why you need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across your team. Your stakeholders will want to discuss things like the project objective, what you need to reach that goal, and any challenges or concerns you have. This is a good thing. These conversations help build trust and confidence in your work. Here's an example of a project with multiple team members. Let's explore what they might need from you at different levels", "evaluation": "exam"}

The first step of that is installing R. First, let's remind ourselves exactly what R is and why we might want to use it. R is both a programming language in an environment focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. It will be one of the main tools you use in this and following courses. R is downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network or CRAN. While this might be your first brush with it, we will be returning to CRAN time and time again when we install packages, so keep an eye out. Use this as a scaffold. For both Windows and Mac machines, we start at the CRAN homepage. If you're on a Windows compute, follow the link Download R for Windows and follow the directions there. If this is your first time installing R, go to the base distribution and click on the link at the top of the page that should say something like Download R version number for Windows. This will download an executable file for installation. Open the executable, and if prompted by a security warning, allow it to run. Select the language you prefer during installation and agree to the licensing information. You will next be prompted for a destination location. This will likely be defaulted to program files in a subfolder called R, followed by another sub-directory for the version number. Unless you have any issues with this, the default location is perfect. You will then be prompted to select which components should be installed. Unless you are running short on memory, installing all of the components is desirable. Next, you'll be asked about startup options and, again, the defaults are fine for this. You will then be asked where setup should place shortcuts. That is completely up to you. I do not recommend changing the defaults for the registry entries", "evaluation": "exam"}

Installing R Now that we've got a handle on what a data scientist is, how to find answers, and then spend some time going over data science example, it's time to get you set up to start exploring on your own. The first step of that is installing R. First, let's remind ourselves exactly what R is and why we might want to use it. R is both a programming language in an environment focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. It will be one of the main tools you use in this and following courses. R is downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network or CRAN. While this might be your first brush with it, we will be returning to CRAN time and time again when we install packages, so keep an eye out. Use this as a scaffold. For both Windows and Mac machines, we start at the CRAN homepage. If you're on a Windows compute, follow the link Download R for Windows and follow the directions there. If this is your first time installing R, go to the base distribution and click on the link at the top of the page that should say something like Download R version number for Windows. This will download an executable file for installation. Open the executable, and if prompted by a security warning, allow it to run. Select the language you prefer during installation and agree to the licensing information. You will next be prompted for a destination location. This will likely be defaulted to program files in a subfolder called R, followed by another sub-directory for the version number. Unless you have any issues with this, the default location is fine for this.\nOutput: Answer 1): Yes\nQuestion 2) Now you are given a very long document. Please follow", "evaluation": "exam"}

RStudio contains a quadrant on the bottom right that allows you to see all of the plots that you have generated within the session. You can use the different arrows to change between previously created graphs and you can save the graphs by using the \"Export\" button\nInstalling R Packages on Windows\nInstalling or loading packages is a must-know function of any data science toolbox. For packages that are not installed with R, they must be installed before we can start to use them. In this lesson, we will focus on installing packages on Windows. The procedures for other machines are very similar, so these instructions can be applied to them as well. All installation processes for R packages will begin with you finding that particular package in CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. We'll walk through these steps with an example.\nGo to CRAN and search for the package \"ggplot2\". Click download to the most recent version of the package, for now we'll just use the most current. This will download the package files to your computer. Now you need to install it. Open R, but leave the console open. You will then go to \"Packages \\(3 dot)\" along the top menu. This will open the package panner. Select \"Install Package\" and click ok when prompted for the installation location. You will be prompted to install the package from zip file; use the browse button to locate the previously downloaded zip file. You will then be asked whether you want to install for a specific user or for all users available on that machine. Only install packages for a specific user if you have administrative rights on that particular machine. Once you have set to install for a particular user, click, \"Install\".\nWhen the package installation is complete, it will be listed as available on the package panner, and you will need to load the package before using it. In the next lesson, we'll work through package installation and loading for Macs and will also cover this concept of loading and using packages in greater detail. However, we will have an extensive lesson on R packages and the most valuable packages in their entirety later in this course.\nWe learned how to install packages for our first time user account in Windows.

The install.packages() function downloads and installs packages from the CRAN repository.\nInstalling R packages is an important step in the data science process. This can be done by first installing the devtools package and then running the command install_github(\"packagename /\"). This command will install the specific package from github that you specify. You will be prompted to enter your password and a temporary password will be displayed in the status window. Finally, it's helpful to restart R after installing a package so that it recognizes the library you just installed and can then be used!\nUsing R to install packages from Github repos\nIt's important to learn how to use R to install packages from Github repos. This skill can be used to quickly access the most up-to-date version of packages, and it also allows you to easily contribute to open source projects. To get started, make sure that you have the latest version of R installed and downloaded. Then, open up an R session, and enter the command remotes::install_github (\"packagename /\"). This will install the specified package from the Github repository and place it into the libraries folder. It's also possible to install multiple packages at once by specifying a list of them, separated by commas. For example: remotes::install_github (\"packagename1 /\", \"packagename2 /\"). After installing the desired package or packages, remember to restart R so that the library will be recognized and loaded.\nQuestion 9.

[\\INST] Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation. Answer: To delete a remote branch, you can make use of the 'delete' function in Git. To do this, use the following syntax:\ngit push origin --delete remote-branch-name\nSo, assuming that you have the remote branch called \"remote-branch-name\" on the \"origin\" remote, you would run the following:\ngit push origin --delete remote-branch-name\nThis should delete the branch from the remote. You can check that the branch has been successfully deleted by running this command:\ngit push origin --delete remote-branch-name\nAnd it should tell you that the branch doesn't exist.

B is the correct answer.\nIn this lesson, we've discussed the major categories of analysis used. We started at description, where we look at descriptive statistics to form summaries of our data. We also discussed exploratory analysis, that looks for the relationships in our datasets. Next, we looked at inferential analysis, where we use data from a smaller sample to get insight on a larger population. Predictive analysis follows, which attempts to use data to predict the future. We finished with causal analysis, which attempts to elicit the relationship between cause and effect in a dataset. Finally, we looked at the application of these analyses to three different sets of data. \nInstead of using descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal, and mechanistic, can I use other classifications: confirmatory, hypothesis generating, exploratory, and predictive analysis to classify my work? \nIn this lesson, we've focused on the goal of our analyses and how these analyses are generally applied to other forms of data and analyses. There is no one right way to do science and you certainly shouldn't be limited to the six categories we looked at. These, we hope should be examples to inspire you to do your own analyses and think about them from a slightly different vantage point. A common practice is to start with an idea and apply descriptive to quantify the size of the effect. Use exploratory to see if there are any relationships that previously unobserved. Make inferences about the relationships with more information and inferential methods. If you have identified a relationship that we can control and manipulate, move on to predict what might happen with predictive, and finally causative, where you can see the result of your manipulations. But these are not the only path to take, and there are plenty of people using the steps in a different order. Sometimes people start with prediction, looking at historical outcomes to predict some future data. Then they take inferential steps to see how confident they are in their predictions. Then use these predictions to make decisions on explorations they may want more information about, or confirm a hypotheses they already had.

With causal analysis, you're making a claim that a particular event, a manipulation, affects you're response or outcome variable.

My job is to help advertising agencies and companies measure success and analyze their data, so I get to meet with lots of different people to show them how data analysis helps with their advertising. Speaking of analysis, you did great earlier learning how to gather and organize data for analysis. It's definitely an important step in the data analysis process, so well done! Now let's talk about how to make sure that your organized data is complete and accurate. Clean data is the key to making sure your data has integrity before you analyze it. We'll show you how to make sure your data is clean and tidy. Cleaning and processing data is one part of the overall data analysis process. As a data analyst, your skills with cleaning data might just end up being something you highlight on your resume when you start job hunting. Once you're done here, you'll have a strong appreciation for clean data and how important it is in the data analysis process.

After you've analyzed all the available data and pulled it together from a lot of different sources, it's normal to feel a sense of relief. You're ready to share the data with different people at your company and help guide decision-making. But are you really? Testing data can help you prevent errors and make sure you're using the right data for your analysis. The testing process involves making sure you've extracted the right data, verified its accuracy, and validated that it supports your objective. The key here is to test early and often. You'll have multiple ways to test your data, which will catch and correct problems before you start your analysis. There are five steps for testing. \nStep 1: Prepare data for analysis\nThere are different types of data structures, such as unstructured data that can only be analyzed with advanced techniques like text mining or sentiment analysis. Knowing this will help you figure out the best ways to prepare and analyze the data. You'll also learn things like which fields can be analyzed and which ones probably aren't a part of your analysis. After you've figured out what data you can analyze, you'll create sample data sets to test. You'll be able to spot errors by comparing the sample and test data.\nStep 2: Run reports to check for incorrect or misaligned information\nI remember seeing a data report that showed how well our ads were performing.

Basing a sample on randomized selection from the whole population helps to ensure that the sample represents the population as a whole. Forcing respondents to self-identify their ethnicity, such as with a survey question, for example, can result in an inaccurately high or low sample representation due to differences in survey response rates between ethnic groups.\nQuestion 10. Which of the following factors can lead to sampling bias? Select all that apply.\nA. A small sample size\nB. Using data from a single source\nC. A sample that is not representative of the population as a whole\nD. Random sampling from large scale data.\nAnswer: A,C\nThis question asks you to select all the factors that can lead to sampling bias. From the given options, an A and C are correct, as the sample size should be sufficient and representative of the population as a whole to avoid bias. A small sample size and a sample that is not representative of the whole population are the two factors that can lead to sampling bias. B and D are incorrect as they do not affect sampling bias. Thus, the answer is A and C.\nHere is an explanation for your question. When sampling, it is important to ensure that the sample size is sufficient to represent the population. To avoid bias, the sample size should be representative of the population.\nQuestion 12. Which sample method involves choosing individuals at random to achieve a sample of a population?

The sample results are more likely to be close to the actual population results. Explanation: A low margin of error indicates that the results of the sample are more likely to be close to the actual population results. It means that the sample is a good representation of the population, and the findings from the sample are reliable. Additionally, it indicates that the difference between the sample results and the actual population results is within an acceptable range. A low margin of error does not necessarily indicate that a high level of confidence was reached. The size of the sample can impact the confidence level, and in some cases, a larger sample size may be needed to achieve the desired level of confidence.

The sample results are more likely to be close to the actual population results. Explanation: A margin of error is closely related to the confidence level, but these are different concepts. The confidence level represents the certainty in which we can say that the population parameter is within the confidence interval of the sample. So the confidence level ranges from 90% to 99%. The margin of error reflects the precision of the sample statistics on which the survey's findings are based.

A null indicates that a value does not exist. A zero is a numerical response.\nThe next type of dirty data, leaving fields blank, or nulls, means the person who entered the data failed to put anything in a particular field. It's also common to leave fields blank if the data doesn't apply to a particular row. For example, if someone on a mailing list is missing a phone number, you might want to include this person in your campaign by using email or texting instead of phone calls. You would need to communicate what you found to your colleagues, such as saying, \"Please, do not call this person at home. Only reach out via email.\" You might also find nulls in numeric data sets. If a bank account ends with an incorrect amount because a customer entered a null in the amount field, the financial system of a bank is most likely to put a hold on the account. This might mean a person won't be able to access funds until the data is verified. Now, the next step is removing duplicates. Let's say you're working with a data set about products sold in an online store. There's lots of product information, but there's a problem: some of it is duplicated. And this kind of thing can definitely cause a lot of headaches. So it's really important that you can find and remove duplicate data. I've already explained a lot about duplicates, and soon you'll get the chance to try your new skills on this topic. Going back to our association membership list example, let's say a data analyst was working on a project that focused only on current members. For example, they wouldn't want to include information on people who are no longer members. Removing irrelevant data takes a little more time and effort because you have to figure out the difference between the data you need and the data you don't. But believe me, making those decisions will save a ton of effort down the road. The next step is removing extra spaces and blanks. Extra spaces can cause unexpected results when you sort, filter, or search through your data. Plus they can lead to the wrong people getting a call, text or email. For example, if there's an extra space and in a member ID number, when you sort the column from lowest to highest, this row will be out of place. To remove these unwanted spaces or blank cells, you can delete them yourself", "evaluation": "exam"}

That's caused by an error. An error is something that's in the dataset that shouldn't be there.\n\nNow, there're also outliers caused by anomalies. Anomalies are the unexpected values that are outside of the usual pattern for a set of data.\nIn the picture on the right, it's an anomaly. All the data there are pretty close together.\nOne thing is definitely out of line.\nIn this image, the data analyst might have thought to remove the error or the outlier based on their definition, however to analyze this properly, one needs to understand the context of the problem.\nIs the outlier expected? Is it an anomaly?\nIn this case, the data analyst would talk with a manager to see why the outlier was there. Maybe the outlier represented a very successful month of sales and didn't need to be removed from the dataset at the end. In any case,\nunderstanding the context of the problem is critical when removing outliers. \n\nNext, you're going to practice using the tools that you've learned so far to clean a dirty dataset. \nHere, you're going to clean a dataset that was created when a manager at an IT department needed to document all its systems and the applications running on them and a separate document was created for each system.\nIf the manager wanted to see how large the IT department was, they would want clean data from the documents,\nthe only problem is that someone mistakenly added duplicate data and some of the names aren't spelled exactly the same.\nThis will create a very dirty dataset.\nThe first step will be to remove duplicates. \nNext, you'll need to fix data where the names are misspelled. \nThen you'll need to fix column headings, formatting, and remove extraneous spaces. Finally, you'll want to correct some data entries.\nOnce you've done all this, your dataset is clean.\n", "evaluation": "exam"}

SUBSTR\nSo Question 8 is asking for the best SQL function to return the first two letters of each country in a column named 'country'. To address this question, it is important to note the function SUBSTR, which can be used to extract a portion of a string by specifying the starting position and the length of the substring we wish to extract. In this case, we need to extract the first 2 letters, so we would use the function SUBSTR to return the first and second character.\nThe complete SQL function to Extract the first 2 letters of each country in 'country' is SUBSTR(country, 1, 2). There are no additional outputs or explanations needed as the answer for this question is provided directly.\nB\\INST]\nIn conclusion, to extract the first two letters of each country in a column named 'country', the SQL function SUBSTR is the best option. The usage would be SUBSTR(country, 1, 2) where the starting position is indicated by 1 and the required length is specified  as 2. This would give us the first and second letter of each country from the country column.\nSo this could be possible based on the question.

[\\INST] [\\INST] [\\INST]\n\nFinal thoughts\nHi there, I hope you enjoyed learning about the tools and strategies for data-cleaning. I know I learned a lot and hope you did too. While we've only scratched the surface in this course, there are great resources out there to discover what can really make your data shine: data-cleaning.\nWe covered so much in this course, such as the importance of data-cleaning, various data-cleaning tools, and the verification and reporting process. We learned that data-cleaning improves data quality and increases user trust, along with enabling more effective analysis and insights. We also discussed tools like a data dictionary, data-cleaning tools, data wrangling tools, data-cleansing techniques, and data-cleaning frameworks. Plus, we identified how data-cleaning can make projects more efficient and help save costs.\nBy the way, there are certain skills and strategies that are useful for data-cleaning, such as being thorough, taking detailed notes and creating a data-cleaning schedule and system. In most projects, a team of humans works on data-cleaning, which can create gaps and conflicts. As we mentioned, it's also recommended to have a second pair of eyes look at data-cleaning, since humans may miss data-cleaning mistakes. This also helps reduce the likelihood of having to go back and start again from scratch. We discussed the importance of verifying clean data to make sure it's reliable, accurate, and error-free. And also important reporting on the cleaning steps and processes.\nThroughout the videos I was joined by real-world data analysts who shared stories from their careers, and also by my colleagues who really brought to life some data-cleaning tools and processes that will help everyone understand how to clean data better. And most importantly, we shared some ways to make data-cleaning more efficient.\nI was thrilled to have you along for the ride and hope you pick up some great tips and tricks in this course. Remember you can rewatch any video from this course to recap anything you want to review in the future.\nI highly recommend going through the other Domo Data School courses too, since there are so many interesting lessons and insights to gain from them.\nThank you", "evaluation": "exam"}

Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation [\\INST]\nAnswer:", "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1-context_extension-stage3-4k_pred": "A, B, and C.\nExplanation: The benefits of using version history are many. This is especially true for data cleaning. Tracking changes made by different users is critical to collaborative data work. This is the best way to make sure changes you made to a spreadsheet or database are not overwritten by someone else. This is a quick way to revert to an old version of the data, if you accidentally save the wrong version or there's a mistake in the data.\nQuestion: How might an analyst use version history to track changes in spreadsheets?\nAnswer: By reviewing the file edit history of the spreadsheet to identify when a specific mistake was made or by manually reviewing spreadsheets to make sure they each have the correct information.\nExplanation: Version history can be used to track changes in spreadsheets. This is usually done by reviewing the history within a spreadsheet. File history can track the changes that were made by a different user. To better understand why documenting your actions and data cleanliness is important, think of version history as a crime TV show. This helps to protect you from fraud or theft. In some cases it allows you to go back and track mistakes you've made in your data or catch and fix errors so your data is credible. Tracking changes that have been made to your spreadsheets and data can ensure you and others who are part of the data collection can all be on the same page at the same time.\nQuestion: How do programmers track changes to software they are working on in order to quickly determine where bugs occurred?\nAnswer: Versioning\nExplanation: The answer to this question is versioning. This is the practice of tagging software code versions so programmers can compare versions and identify differences. Programmers can use the code version number to identify changes to a specific piece of code and determine exactly where a bug occurred during the development process. Tracking changes and keeping them organized using a versioning system is one of the best ways for a programmer to develop clean and error-free software code.\nQuestion: What are the three main elements the data analyst should track when keeping version history in a spreadsheet?\nAnswer: Change history, who made changes and when changes occurred.\nExplanation: Three main elements that a data analyst should track when keeping version history are: change history, who made the changes and when they were made.

What is the difference between regularization and weight decay in a neural network, when used for a classification task? Can anyone explain me the difference between regularization and weight decay [\\INST]\nAnswer: Regularization and weight decay are often used together in neural networks to prevent overfitting. Regularization refers to any technique that modifies or penalizes the output of a neural network to improve its generalization ability. On the other hand, weight decay refers to a specific regularization method that penalizes model parameters (weights and biases) to prevent overfitting. Weight decay encourages the model to use fewer parameters by penalizing the magnitude of the model parameters. This helps to reduce overfitting and improves generalizability. You can use L2 or L1 norms to compute the magnitude of parameters, resulting in L2 regularization or L1 regularization, respectively.\nQuestion 3. Can weight decay be implemented separately from regularization in a neural network?\n[\\INST]\nAnswer: Yes, weight decay can be implemented separately from regularization in a neural network. Both techniques are different ways to reduce the magnitude of model parameters and prevent overfitting. Weight decay modifies the objective function to penalize model parameters with a regularization coefficient, while regularization techniques modify the model architecture or change its behavior during training to prevent overfitting.\nQuestion 4. Why is it important to use regularization techniques like weight decay in deep neural networks? What is the impact of using weight decay in a neural network?\n[\\INST]\nAnswer: Regularization techniques like weight decay are important in deep neural networks as they help in preventing overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns specific training data patterns instead of finding generalizable features or patterns. Regularization techniques like weight decay penalize or introduce noise to reduce the complexities of the model, which mitigates overfitting and improves generalization ability. Weight decay adds a coefficient multiplying the weighted sum of square (L2 norm) of all weights, making the model sparse and more generalizable. It introduces model diversity and makes networks robust to overfitting.\nQuestion 5. How does weight decay influence the learning rate during training? Does it affect the convergence rate or epoch count required for training? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Weight decay can influence the choice of learning rate and the training speed. By introducing a regularization term, weight decay reduces", "evaluation": "exam"}

Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation [\\INST]\nAnswer:", "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1-context_extension-stage3-4k_pred": "B\nCorrect Answer Explanation:  Dropout regularization is a technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. It does this by randomly dropping some neurons or connections during the training process, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are less dependent on specific input patterns.\nQuestion 2. In which machine learning model can you apply regularization?\nAnswer: The most popular ones use for regularization are regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.\nQuestion 3. What is the main purpose of regularization in machine learning?\nAnswer: The main purpose of regularization is to reduce overfitting, which often happens when machine learning models are trained on a small dataset.\nQuestion 4. Which method of regularization is most commonly used in machine learning?\nAnswer: The most common form of regularization is L2 regularization, which adds a penalty to the cost function for large weights (parameters).\nQuestion 5. What are some other techniques that are commonly used to improve generalization and reduce overfitting in machine learning?\nAnswer: Other techniques include increasing the size of the training dataset, adding more data augmentations to the training dataset, and using ensemble methods such as bagging and boosting to combine the predictions of multiple models.\nQuestion 6. What is one benefit of using regularization in machine learning?\nAnswer: One benefit of using regularization is that it allows the model to generalize better to new data, which makes it less likely to overfit the training data.\nQuestion 7. How does L1 regularization work?\nAnswer: L1 regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function for the absolute value of the weights, which effectively shrinks the weights towards zero while still allowing for a few large weights.\nQuestion 8. What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting in machine learning?\nAnswer: Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data and can't accurately predict new data. Underfitting occurs when the model doesn't learn enough from the training data and has a low accuracy on the training data.\nQuestion 9. What is the advantage of using dropout regularization?\nAnswer: The advantage of using dropout regularization is that it reduces overfitting by randomly removing neurons during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on", "evaluation": "exam"}
