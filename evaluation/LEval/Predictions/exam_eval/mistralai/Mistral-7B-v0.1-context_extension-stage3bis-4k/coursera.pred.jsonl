The Cambridge definition focuses on the actions that surround data, i.e., collecting, examining, and using data to make decisions. On the other hand, the Wikipedia definition focuses on what data entails. It describes data as values, or numbers that are measured on a set of items or individuals. It also mentions qualitative and quantitative variables.\nQualitative variables represent categories of measurements, usually described by words and are not necessarily ordered. Examples include country of origin, sex, or treatment group.\nQuantitative variables represent measurements of quantities that are usually described by numbers and ordered. These include height, weight, and blood pressure.\nDifferent types of data sources provide data that can be used to answer questions and derive insights.\nSequencing data is one type where data is mostly in the fastq format and needs to be parsed to extract information. The data is usually in the form of millions of lines of code and provides information about sequencing results. This data may be useful in genomics research.\nCensuses are commonly used to generate data about a country's population. It's a government-conducted survey where individuals answer predefined and standardized questions and submit them. In cases where almost all members of a country participate, these data can aid research on the population and make inferences about them.\nElectronic Medical Records store health information for individuals using a computerized system. The information can be used to derive insights about medical conditions and improve healthcare.\nImages and videos are other data sources where valuable information can be extracted to make inferences about the objects in the images or video stream. For instance, images can be analyzed to generate a population pyramid. In an image with faces, a machine learning algorithm can suggest potential faces (e.g., Google's Deep Dream).\nAnswering questions before looking at available data and data driven questions are important aspects of data science.

Shuffling ensures that the model sees a diverse set of examples in each mini-batch, which can help the model generalize better. \n\n\n\nINST: Please explain the answer for Question 8 in more detail, specifically how shuffling can help the model generalize better and also provide examples of how shuffling can speed up the training process or help prevent overfitting.\n\n\nMini-batch gradient descent is a popular technique used to train deep neural networks on large-scale datasets. One key factor that affects the performance of mini-batch gradient descent is the size of the mini-batch and the order of the training examples within the batch. Shuffling the training data, i.e., randomly ordering the examples in the batch, helps ensure that the model sees a diverse set of examples in each batch. This can help the model generalize better and make more accurate predictions on new test data. For example, consider a model that is trained to recognize handwritten numerals in a digit recognition task. If the training data is not shuffled, the model may become biased towards a certain set of handwritten numbers and have difficulty recognizing unseen examples in the test set. In contrast, shuffling ensures that the model sees a diverse set of training examples and learns from the variability in the data, making it less likely to overfit or have a bias towards any particular patterns.\nHowever, shuffling is not just limited to improving generalization, it can also speed up the training process. Because mini-batch gradient descent operates on a set of training examples rather than the whole data set, the order of the examples in the batch can impact the convergence rate of the model. If the model is repeatedly exposed to easy examples first, it may take longer to reach convergence due to the decreased gradient updates on those easy examples. Shuffling ensures that the model sees a mix of easy and challenging examples in each batch, which can lead to more diverse gradient updates and faster convergence.\nMoreover, shuffling helps prevent the risk of overfitting the model, which occurs when the model learns too much about the training data, leading to poor performance on new test data. By mixing up the order of the training examples, shuffling prevents the model from memorizing the order of the examples and becoming biased towards those patterns. Instead, it learns from the overall variability of the data, leading to features that are more robust and generalizable", "evaluation": "exam"}

The depth of the network. Incorrect options: A. The choice of activation function. C. The initialization of weights. D. The learning rate.  The vanishing gradient problem in deep neural networks can be caused by a combination of several factors. The depth of the network, i.e., the number of layers, is one of these factors. When the network's layers increase in depth, the gradients tend to shrink (or even vanish) as they propagate backward through the network. This is because the error or loss signals from the output layer need to pass through all layers, and the gradients get scaled by the parameters of each layer in the process, potentially resulting in a significant reduction in their size.[/INST]", "evaluation": "exam"}

A graphical user interface for R and an integrated development environment for R programming \n\n\nInstalling R Packages\nI  already have RStudio downloaded onto my computer.\nIf we want to extend functionality of R, what we do is we install software programs called packages. These are programs that extend R's core functionality. Some packages are designed to do specific statistical analysis, others generate interactive graphs or other more specialized functions. The more packages you can use, the better, but they will have to be installed individually. Installing a package is also known as load a package. Loading a package means that we will be using it for the session. Let's say that you want to do some linear regression with R and you want to make sure you're using the right version of the software. We will load the package linear models and then run the command for a linear regression model. We will then see that version of the package loaded. One drawback to loading individual packages is that once you quit R, all packages that you had loaded are unloaded and then need to be reloaded again. The solution to that is to load a package called library. The first time you install a package, you need to specify the path to it in the library. At this time, R makes a copy of the package, so library has a record of how to find it after it was installed. You will not have to reinstall the package again using install. If you want to load that package again, you simply use require and R will know where to find it. Let's try to install some common R packages that you will be using. Installing the library, we recommend \"tidyverse\" and \"purrr\". Both of these are in Rstudio's install package browser if you click \"install.\" \"Tidyverse\" is a whole series packages that help you manipulate and analyze tabular data. It essentially combines several packages into a single \"library.\" \"Purrr\" is a library that allows you to manipulate and transform simple data structures like lists using specific functions. Now, let's add them to the library. In the example window I just typed the following. The library command installs packages, so we see the message that we did that for both of the packages we added. We can now manipulate these packages in R. It might work to write the word require before the tidyverse in the same way that we", "evaluation": "exam"}

Version Control Now that we've got a handle on our RStudio and projects, there are a few more things we want to set you up with before moving on to the other courses, understanding version control, installing Git, and linking Git with RStudio. In this lesson, we will give you a basic understanding of version control. First things first, what is version control? Version control is a system that records changes that are made to a file or a set of files over time. As you make edits, the version control system takes snapshots of your files and the changes and then saves those snapshots so you can refer, revert back to previous versions later if need be. If you've ever used the track changes feature in Microsoft Word, you have seen a rudimentary type of version control in which the changes you made are tracked and you can either choose to keep those edits or revert to the original, unbroken code leaving everything else you've done in the meanwhile on touched. Finally, when working with a group of people on the same set of files, version control is helpful for ensuring that you aren't making changes to files that conflict with other changes. If you've ever shared a document with another person for editing, you know the frustration of integrating their edits with a document that has changed since you sent the original file. Now, you have two versions of that same original document. Version control allows multiple people to work on the same file and then helps merge all of the versions of the file and all of their edits into one cohesive file. Git is a free and open source version control system. It was developed in 2005 and has since become the most commonly used version control system around. Stack Overflow which should sound familiar from our getting help lesson surveyed over 60,000 respondents on which version control system they use. As you can tell from the chart, Git is by far the winner. As you become more familiar with Git and how it works in interfaces with your projects, you'll begin to see why it has risen to the height of popularity. One of the main benefits of Git is that it keeps a local copy of your work and revisions which you can then netted offline.", "evaluation": "exam"}

In this lesson, you will sign up for a GitHub account, navigate around the GitHub website to become familiar with some of its features and install and configure Git. All in preparation for linking both with your RStudio. As we previously learned, GitHub is a cloud-based management system for your version controlled files. Like Dropbox, your files are both locally on your computer and hosted online and easily accessible. Its interface allows you to manage version control and provides users with a web-based interface for creating projects, sharing them, updating code, etc. To get a GitHub account, first go to www.github.com. You will be brought to their homepage where you should fill in your information, make a username, put in your email, choose a secure password, and click sign up for GitHub. You should now be logged into GitHub. In the future, to log onto GitHub, go to github.com where you will be presented with a homepage. If you aren't already logged in, click on the sign in link at the top. Once you've done that, you will see the login page where you will enter in your username and password that you created earlier. Once logged in, you will be back at github.com but this time the screen should look like this. We're going to take a quick tour of the GitHub website and we'll particularly focus on these sections of the interface, user settings, notifications, help files, and the GitHub guide. Following this tour, will make your very first repository using the GitHub guide. First, let's look at your user settings. Now that you've logged onto GitHub, we should fill out some of your profile information and get acquainted with the account settings. In the upper right corner, there is an icon with a narrow beside it. Click this and go to your profile. This is where you control your account from and can view your contribution, histories, and repositories.

We can also specify an email address, in this case \"git config --global user.email \"Your email.\" This email can then be used by other people as an identification to commit to a shared repository. Additionally, you can also specify the editor that Git will use by default. For example, here is \"git config --global core.editor nano\" or \"git config --global core.editor emacs\".

The list items will be concatenated into a single line. \nWe know that Question 3 asks about bulleted lists in R Markdown. From the document we are asked to follow: \n- Lists are easily created by proceeding each perspective bullet point by a single dash, followed by a space. Importantly, at the end of each bullets line, end with two spaces. This is a quirk of R Markdown that will cause spacing problems if not included. This is an important step in creating a bulleted list in R Markdown, especially when there are multiple items. If you fail to add empty spaces at the end of each bullet point, the entire line will be concatenated into a single line. This is not a common issue in other types of text processing, but we can see its importance in R Markdown.\nCitation: R Markdown documentation. 2022. https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/R-markdown-cheatsheet.pdf  .\nGibbons, R.

Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation\"  The correct answer is D Predictive. Predictive analysis is aimed at using current and historical data to find patterns and predict the likelihood of future outcomes.\n\nBy using past stock market data, it is possible to make predictions about future stock prices. This type of analysis can be helpful for traders and investors who want to make informed decisions based on historical trends. However, it\u2019s important to note that even with large amounts of data and a simple model, predicting the future stock prices is still difficult due to unpredictable events and changes in the market.\n\nExplanation: \n\nIn the context of this question, the answer provided is true. Predictive analysis is an appropriate type of analysis to use when predicting future outcomes based on current and historical data. By examining the relationships between variables such as stock prices and historical trends, it is possible to make predictions about future stock prices. However, factors such as unexpected events, market changes and individual trading patterns can make predicting stock prices very difficult. Therefore, even with large amounts of data and a simple model, predicting future stock prices remains a challenging task that requires careful analysis.\n\nPredictive analysis is a data mining and machine learning approach that involves the use of data and statistical techniques to predict future events or outcomes, rather than just describing or observing patterns in past data. This type of data analysis is common in many fields, including business, medicine, scientific research, and more. Additionally, predictive analysis is often used to provide insights into behavior patterns and patterns of usage of a product or service.\n\nThe example of a survey on voter approval of President Joe Biden provides valuable information about the perceived strength of the President's approval among voters. The survey revealed that two-thirds of those who registered to vote approved of Biden, which is a positive indication of the President's popularity. While the survey only provides a glimpse of the population's views and does not speak for everyone who is eligible to vote, it is essential to conduct such surveys to gauge the opinions of the public on different issues.\n\nOverall, descriptive and exploratory analyses aim to describe and summarize the observed data, while inferential and predictive analyses aim at drawing conclusions and making predictions from the observed data.

You could just collect data from the population, but there's a chance that people like the first few respondents are different from the population as a whole. This would provide you with results that were inaccurate.\nTo learn about random sampling, first understand sampling error. Sampling error is what happens when you're trying to make a determination about the whole population with a particular sample size. You know you have sampling error to consider. You just might not know how much of an issue it is. A common error is sampling bias, which occurs when a sample isn't chosen at random or doesn't represent the entire population. This can compromise the validity of your results because people with certain characteristics may be left out. For example, it could mean that people with certain attitudes or behaviors would be represented in a sample. Or that people of a certain race, gender, or income level might be disproportionately represented while others are underrepresented. One effective way to solve these issues is with random sampling, which is a technique for choosing samples from a population. If you've used a random sample, you know you won't be dealing with sampling bias. It's important to note that random sampling doesn't eliminate all sampling errors. In fact, if you pull a truly random sample from a very large population, it's likely the results will be slightly different than those of the whole population. This small difference between sample results and the whole population is called sampling error. Your chances of getting more accurate results with a large sample size will be better than with a small sample size, but you'll only be able to achieve statistical significance, or a statistically meaningful result, if your sample size is appropriate for your analysis.

I've been studying crime shows a bit lately, and that might have influenced my thinking. \nYes, this is because they are valuable tools when it comes to summarizing data and organizing it. As you saw, in the previous video we were able to analyze the number of misspellings in the data, which is a great example of how pivot tables can identify repeat errors in your data. But they're also used to group and count data, which you'll become more familiar with as you continue your training. So yes, pivot tables are very useful tools for cleaning data.\n\nDocumenting data-cleaning changes\nHi, there. In this video we'll explore one of the last steps in verification, which involves documenting all the changes you've made to the data during the cleaning process. Documenting your cleaning work is important for two reasons. For one, it's an effective way of communicating with yourself and your team so that everyone is aware of all the changes that have occurred. Documentation also keeps a record of all your cleaning changes in case anyone wants to review it later, or if you want to get a head start on planning the next cleaning project. Documentation can come in many different forms, but we'll be focusing on these two primary approaches to recording your cleaning work- change logs and documentation. A change log, otherwise known as a changelog, is a chronologically ordered list of modification made to your project. Imagine if somebody looked at your changelog and saw a line that said, \"Changed first_name spelling from P-L-O-S to P-L-U-S. \" That would make it clear the change that you made and also give details about how, when, and why it was done. Change logs are very useful files to keep because they let others know about all the cleaning changes you've made without you having to explain each one individually. So the next time a co-worker is interested in where the product data came from, you can simply point them to the changelog. Change logs are also valuable reference tools that can be used to avoid common mistakes later on.\nAnother valuable form of documentation is keeping a written record of", "evaluation": "exam"}

It involves reviewing the unclean dataset and comparing it to the clean version, as well as taking a big-picture view of the project to ensure that your data is capable of solving the problem at hand. There are various tools that can help you fix common errors to save time during verification, including find and replace, remove duplicates, and pivot tables.

Output is not requested but answer contains additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer to Question 4 is (D): Dropout is not applied and the keep_prob factor is not used in the calculations at test time.\nA is incorrect because dropout is applied during training but not during testing. Dropout is applied during training to prevent overfitting and reduce variance by randomly setting a fraction of the network's hidden units to 0. However, during testing, the keep_prob factor is not used to retain the full network during testing to make predictions.\nB is incorrect because dropout is applied during training, but during testing, dropout is not applied, and the keep_prob factor is not used. The keep_prob factor is used during training to determine the probability of keeping a hidden unit active or to drop it from the network.\nC is incorrect because dropout is not applied during testing, and the keep_prob factor is also not used during testing. The network is treated as fully connected and activated during testing to make predictions.\nA is the correct answer because dropout is not applied, and the keep_prob factor is also not used during testing.

The reason is that we want to ensure that the model is training on data that is similar to what it will encounter in the real world.
