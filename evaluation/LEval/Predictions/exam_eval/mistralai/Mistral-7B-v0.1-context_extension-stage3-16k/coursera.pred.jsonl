This is a course focused on tools in the R programming language, how they work and how to use them properly. R is the most commonly used programming language for data scientists and is the language of choice for most in the statistical, analytical, and machine learning communities. I am sure many of you will use or are already using R for your data science projects. If you are not using R, then this course will give you the tools to help you get comfortable with this programming language. In this course, we\u2019ll cover the basics of R, and provide examples of how to get organized and write code on your RStudio interface, and ultimately get the data you need to analyze. We\u2019ll go over installing R and RStudio and get a feel for the tools that are provided and which we may use in future courses. From there we\u2019ll dive into creating simple objects using different data types in R, and then learn how to analyze these objects using the tools and functions found in the R programming language like the vectorize and apply functions. Lastly, we\u2019ll look into creating", "evaluation": "exam"}

Explain what data science is in your own words. [\\INST]\nData Science is a very broad field of study. A field which involves using data to answer questions. In this sense data is any information we collect to formulate our question and find the answer.\n\nWhat is programming?\nIn this lesson, we'll define what programming is before discussing it's uses across different fields. Then, we'll provide advice on how to get the most out of this lesson, before diving into the details of programming. Specifically, we're going to define exactly what a program is and talk about high level vs low level languages. Then, we'll discuss what a library is and how it can be used. Finally, we'll finish up by giving you practical advice on how to use the material in this lesson before going out and learning about and programming language.\nFirst, let's talk about exactly what programming is. One of the best definitions I've heard is that, \"Programming is the implementation of computer programs.\" So it's the way we put the computers we're using into action by providing them with instructions about how to accomplish certain tasks. Often you see this defined a little more precisely as the art of designing computer software through the use of high level programming languages.\nIf we're going to understand what programming languages are and how they differ, it's important first to know exactly what a program is. So, a program is sequence of instructions that cause the computer to perform some action. In other words, it's the data we give to the computer telling what it's supposed to do. A program could instruct the computer to do seemingly simple things, like adding two and two. It could also ask the computer to carry out an extremely complex task like organizing your entire life.\nWith this definition in mind, let's think about how a computer actually does something with a program. If I give my computer instructions to search the internet for information relevant to the topics in one of my YouTube videos, how will the machine actually do that", "evaluation": "exam"}

[\\INST]\nAnswer: Answer is as follows.\nThere are a few qualities that characterize big data. The first is volume. As the name implies, big data involves large datasets. These large datasets are becoming more and more routine. For example, say you had a question about online video. Well, YouTube has approximately 300 hours of video uploaded every minute. You would definitely have a lot of data available to you to analyze. But you can see how this might be a difficult problem to wrangle all of that data. This brings us to the second quality of Big Data, velocity. Data is being generated and collected faster than ever before. In our YouTube example, new data is coming at you every minute. In a completely different example, say you have a question about shipping times of rats. Well, most transport trucks have real-time GPS data available. You could in real time analyze the trucks movements if you have the tools and skills to do so. The third quality of big data is variety. In the examples I've mentioned so far, you have different types of data available to you. In the YouTube example, you could be analyzing video or audio, which is a very unstructured dataset, or you could have a database of video lengths, views or comments, which is a much more structured data set to analyze. So, we've talked about what data science is and what sorts of data it deals with, but something else we need to discuss is what exactly a data scientist is. The most basic of definitions would be that a data scientist is somebody who uses data to answer questions. But more importantly to you, what skills does a data scientist embody? To answer this, we have this illustrative Venn diagram in which data science is the intersection of three sectors, substantive expertise, hacking skills, and math and statistics.

Thanks.\nWhy wouldn't you take a random sample from your population to study it?\nThe thing is, you usually can't study a random sample from your population of interest because it's often impossible to do so. For example, you can't randomly select people who are about to die in a car accident and study them. Or you can't randomly select soldiers about to go into battle and study them. In situations like these where the population cannot be sampled from, you have to look to another way to get your data.

Please explain why \u03b21,\u03b22 and \u03b5 in Adam are called hyperparameters, and why they are called default values. [\\INST]\nAnswer: \u03b21,\u03b22 and \u03b5 are all just values like the initial learning. They can be chosen based on experimentation, but they don't change during gradient descent. In particular \u03b5 is a tiny value that helps when computing the root mean square of a miniscule quantity. For a long time they were just default values because it turns out that \u03b21=0.9, \u03b22=0.999, and \u03b5=10\u22128 worked pretty well.\nQuestion 2. In the context of neural networks, describe which type of learning model is associated with local optima and which type of learning model is associated with saddle points. [\\INST]\nAnswer: In the context of neural networks, a neural network (the local model) is much more likely to stumble onto a saddle point rather than a local optimum.\nQuestion 3. Describe an intuition for why a saddle point would be more likely to occur than a local optimum in a learning algorithm with 20,000 parameters. [\\INST]\nAnswer:  Because there are so many more dimensions to vary in a learning algorithm with 20,000 parameters.\nQuestion 4. For the purposes of neural network training, describe why saddle points are more likely to be a hurdle than local optima. [\\INST]\nAnswer: If a saddle point is reached, it will stall training in that location. But a local optimum will still drive training because training can always go in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss, even if the magnitude of the gradient is small.\nQuestion 5. When a machine learning learning algorithm reaches a saddle point, which part of the algorithm might have to work harder to \u201cpush through\u201d the point?

Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation [\\INST]\nAnswer:", "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1-context_extension-stage3-16k_pred": "Answer: The correct answer is option A. Using mini-batch gradient descent instead of batch gradient descent can help to reduce the memory requirements during training. This is because in mini-batch gradient descent, only a subset of the training data is used at each training step, thereby reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded in memory. However, options B, C, and D are not effective in reducing the memory requirements during training, as they do not directly address the issue of reducing the amount of data that needs to be loaded in memory.\nQuestion: What is the purpose of using momentum in a machine learning algorithm \\[\\INST\\] [\\INST]\nAnswer: The purpose of using momentum in a machine learning algorithm is to prevent large and sudden changes when updating the network weights, which can often lead to overfitting or other undesirable effects. Momentum acts as a form of smoothing, helping to keep the updates continuous and moving in the same trajectory, rather than being constantly thrown off course by large changes. This helps to stabilize the training process and improve the performance of the model.\nQuestion: [\\INST] How does Adam optimization algorithm tackle local optima during training \\[\\INST\\] [\\INST]\nAnswer: Adam optimization algorithm does not explicitly tackle local optima during training. Instead, it uses the adaptive estimation of first and second moment parameters to update the model parameters which helps to avoid overfitting and converge the model to a global optimum. If the model is stuck in a local optima, the Adam algorithm will continue to optimize the parameters towards the global optimum until convergence is achieved.\nQuestion 3 [\\INST] What is the advantage of weight decay in a deep learning model \\[\\INST\\] [\\INST].\nAnswer: By adding weight decay to a deep learning model, the model\u2019s internal parameters are penalized with a regularization term during the training process.

What is the key role of the activation function in a neural network? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Output: 1. The activation function is important because it allows the network to use gradient descent without exploding or vanishing gradients.\nQuestion 6. What is the difference between a fully connected layer and a convolutional layer in a neural network? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Output: 1. A fully connected layer is also known as the Dense Layer, in which every node in the previous layer is connected to every node in the next layer. Convolutional layers are used for image and video data, where it focuses on extracting spatial or temporal correlations in the data.\nQuestion 7. What is backpropagation and what is it used for in neural network training? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Output: 1. Backpropagation is the process used by artificial neural networks for training.

Can you please clarify what the output of a machine learning model should be?\nAnswer: 1. The model's output typically contains a predicted probability for a given input. To find the exact output values, one needs to define a threshold. Then, the outputs are checked against the defined threshold which helps to find the desired outcomes for the input data. It is advisable to have a clear idea of the probability threshold before making decisions based on predictions.\nQuestion 10. When to use the LSTM layers? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Output: 1.

To improve the generalization performance and stabilize the training process.\nQuestion: Question 7. For neural networks, what is the purpose of using the Dropout technique? Please provide an answer directly, without any additional output or explanation [\\INST]\nAnswer: Dropout is a well-known regularization technique that helps to mitigate the problem of overfitting. In short, it randomizes or disables some portions of the neural network by temporarily dropping a portion of the input data during training. For instance, suppose that at each training step, only 67% of the inputs are passed to the network for training. In this way, overfitting is mitigated, and the neural network can learn more robust representations as it needs to focus on only a portion of the data at once.\nQuestion: The question is: What is the key difference between cross-entropy and mean squared error? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Cross-entropy is suitable for classification tasks. It measures the distance between the probability distributions of predicted and target outputs.

Mini-batch gradient descent has all the advantages of batch gradient descent, plus it can update the weights faster since it only takes a mini-batch of training data at a time. Also, gradient descent with mini-batch is the default implementation in most modern libraries so it's easily available and generally very well-optimized.\n1. I think you only need to tune learning rate with mini-batch gradient descent (because the mini-batches are relatively small, so the noise makes it much more difficult to select the optimal learning rate). As for tuning hyper parameters such as the learning rate of mini-batch gradient descent and Adam: we use cross-validation to find it.\n2. I'm surprised to hear that people still use batch gradient descent to train machine learning and deep learning models. For most machine learning and deep learning applications, I strongly recommend you use mini-batch gradient descent. Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a form of stochastic optimization (a process by which the loss and optimization strategy are computed iteratively) in machine learning, deep learning, and other forms of adaptive pattern recognition. In practice, it is the default mode of optimization in various machine learning libraries. It has several advantages, including:\na) It avoids problems with memorization, overfitting, and local minima,\nb) It's much faster than either batch gradient descent or vanilla stochastic gradient descent (SGD)\nc) It allows us to vectorize the code for maximum computational efficiency\nSo, if you're using machine learning or deep learning, definitely consider mini-batch gradient descent!\n3. This is a great question!\nYou asked, \"I'm not sure if it's possible to avoid gradient descent. For example, if you train a linear regression model using one-hot encodings using batch gradient descent, how would you avoid gradient descent after that?\"\nWhen would people use batch gradient descent? Well, the most common case is when you use it for linear regression because you're only learning one parameter -- the gradient of that parameter becomes zero once it's been optimized. In that case, you don't need to do further gradient descent. But, if your model is more sophisticated, with more than one parameter, then you would still want to learn other parameters, and to do that you'll need some sort of minimization algorithm, and these commonly", "evaluation": "exam"}

Dropout regularization involves randomly dropping out units during training, which prevents the network from overfitting and makes it easier for the network to converge on a lower loss. Additionally, if the dropout rate is set too high, only a small portion of the network is activated at any given time, reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, and as a consequence, the vanishing gradient problem.\nQuestion: Question 10. What is the difference between overfitting and underfitting?  [\\INST]\nAnswer: Overfitting is when a model can accurately predict the training data but performs poorly when making predictions on new data. On the other hand, underfitting occurs when a model has high bias. In other words, the model is too simplistic and doesn't learn enough from the training data to generalize to new data.\nQuestion: Question 11. You are training a neural network on a dataset with labeled data. What should you do to avoid overfitting the model to the training data?

Answer is option A, Using regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization will reduce variance (which can cause overfitting), but not bias for which it is underfit. Options B, C, and D, in the context of avoiding overfitting don't make much sense.

(Select all relevant options)\nAnswer: Options A and C.\nOption A is a valid option because mini-batch gradient descent is helpful in achieving lower values for the cost function more quickly. Instead of using the entire dataset each time to compute the gradient update, you process only a small subset of those in each iteration. So you process smaller sets and more frequent updates.

A mini-batch\nI hope this gives you a sense of how you can implement softmax regression. In the next video, we'll jump into the deep learning frameworks that make using a softmax layer and using softmax activation functions much easier.\n\nDeep Learning Frameworks\nSo far, we have discussed how you can use gradient descent to do optimization on your neural networks in the end. Now, deep learning frameworks, which are packages that make using machine learning model much easier. You should have noticed that using stochastic gradient descent to train a model is a tedious process where you repeatedly have to update the network's parameters in a loop. You have to go through this many times, and it's tedious for you to do it by hand. Deep learning framework is a package which basically automates all the steps for you so that you can just write down your neural network and then feed in a training set. And it will then take care of everything. So for example, if your neural network is composed of a fully connected layer, a ReLU layer, and an output or softmax layer, then you use a deep learning framework. It will then automatically go step by step go through to get your gradient, run the gradient descent updates for you. It will automatically keep track of what parameters are what, and so everything from the optimization part, or the training process of the neural network, is then basically taken care of by the deep learning framework. So once you learn how to use a particular deep learning framework, it can be much easier for you to train a neural network than having to do it by hand. Now, let's take a look at what you should be able to do with a deep learning framework. When you use a deep learning framework, in order to train a neural network, the deep learning framework will then take care of all of the steps, such as updating the learning rate, picking this initialization, and so on. The idea is that in order for you to train a network, the deep learning framework itself has to use some sort of initialization strategy, for example, X avi. Then, it has to have some form of learning rate selection, such as Ada Gradient where your learning rates are just modified to go down.\nIf you're using stochastic gradient descent, it has to choose the mini-batch size it runs over the mini-batch it uses to compute the gradients and so on.

It's an example of the training where a Softmax layer where we have the five different classes and then for each different class, we color the corresponding training example with the corresponding class. And then finally the training will just take an image and find what's the class with the highest probability, then it's going to output the corresponding color that the example belongs to. This gives you a sense of how batch normalization works because notice that we're using this same image over and over again. Here it is in green here, it's in orange is here. And the same applies at test time, you're using the same value z all the times. And instead of having a moving average of z, we've just hard-wired in a specific value z. So, this is an image that's going to get the same z, and it's going to cause the first node of the soft max layer to have probability of 0 for all classes, and so it's going to output the red color.\nAnd this other image on the right, it gets the same z and it's going to output the blue color. Because here, the first element of the probability output is going to be much bigger. So each of these images gets the same input, but because of the different z it's going to output a different class label. Here's another example. Here is an image, the same image in the previous example, and notice here that the second element and the third element of this probability is going to be very close to 0. And the fourth element's going to be a bit bigger and so we're outputting the third class in contrast to the first two examples where the first element was the biggest element of the probability vector.

The process helps you harness data analytics as a way to meet business needs. The data analysis process starts with asking a question, then moves into data preparation, data processing, data analysis, creating a shareable report, and finally, using the report findings to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions. This process is the framework behind solving big business problems. When you learn to solve problems with data by applying this framework, you can set yourself up for a career that keeps you and employers growing. You can expect to be in growing demand as well as the demand for data analysis will only continue to increase for businesses that want to stay competitive.

Now that you've learned what makes a question effective, let's focus on action. As a data analyst, when crafting high quality questions, you should ask yourself things like, do my analyses answer the original questions? Or, are there other angles I haven't considered? Questions like these enable data analysts to make informed decisions and then take effective action. As an example, let's think about the airline industry. What if an airline was trying to understand how they could keep fliers seated and on time for their flights during a particularly unpredictable winter storm season. The company may use data to look at historical flight performance, staff performance during past storms, and potential scheduling conflicts with past storms. Then the data analyst may take data from each of these sources and compare it with the airline\u2019s goals. This comparison may help the data analyst identify potential changes that could address the company's winter storm issue. So that's two instances in which the questions helped. First, they helped guide the data analysts in formulating answers to the original questions. And then the analyst looked at all angles to figure out what new questions to ask. This second instance enabled the data analyst to see additional potential opportunities to help the company solve its problem. Those are two ways effective questions enabled the data analysts to take action.\n\nStructured thinking and data analytics\n[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Ximena and thank you for joining me for the fifth unit of the Google data analysis for beginners course, let's start off by defining structured thinking.

Now that you've gotten to know some of the challenges and benefits of working with both big and small data, it's time to jump headfirst into your first big project. Your job is to use two different spreadsheets tools and a mathematical approach to analyze data and help stakeholders better understand the business challenges they're solving for. Just remember to think back on what I said about small and big data, and what the different aspects of a problem are, before starting your analysis.\n \nSpreadsheet software allows you to organize, analyze, and visualize data more effectively. Spreadsheets are helpful software for creating dynamic and visually appealing tables of data that can be shared with others. This makes them perfect to use with the analysis process. Let's start by looking at exactly what spreadsheets are and how you can use them.\nWhat is a spreadsheet?\nSo what is a spreadsheet anyway? A spreadsheet is an organized digital sheet of data using a spreadsheet application that displays data in structured cells in grids of columns and rows. Spreadsheets are a great place to start your first data analysis project. \nA basic spreadsheet is made up of rows and columns, where data is held in an individual cell. Columns are a collection of cells that span horizontally, while rows are a collection of cells that span vertically. You can use spreadsheets to organize, analyze, and visualize tons of different types of data. \nWhen you set aside data into spreadsheets, they become a lot more manageable, making them easier to understand, and, eventually, analyze. \nSpreadsheets organize data\nIn this spreadsheet, there's an example of a wholesale order database. The data contains information about the buyer, wholesaler, product, and the amount purchased. As you can see, all the data is kept separate within their designated cells. This helps us get a better look at the data before we explore the best way to analyze it. Spreadsheets organize data in specific, labeled cells for us to see how they all fit together.\nLet's think about how we could organize the order data more efficiently. We'll start by getting rid of the columns with labels to the left. Now the first column would have the buyer's user ID number, the second", "evaluation": "exam"}

Please directly give answer without any additonal output or explanation [\\INST]\nAnswer:", "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1-context_extension-stage3-16k_pred": "A.\nHere's the solution for Question 11\nA. Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial ratio that measures the rate of return on an investment relative to the amount of money invested. ROI is used to calculate the profitability of an investment, and can be used to analyze financial decisions. The ROI formula is calculated as: \nROI = net profit / cost of investment\nROI typically is expressed as a percentage. An ROI of 100% means that for every dollar a company invests, it returns a dollar. An ROI of 200% would mean that a company earned a net profit of $2 for every $1 invested.\nROI helps investors analyze potential investments and evaluate a company\u2019s financial strength.\nIn practice, ROI is used to help calculate the return on investments and help compare investments. The return on investment is calculated by dividing the investment by the number of times the ROI is expected to be earned. For example, if a stock is purchased at $100 and the investor expects it to pay dividends of $5 per year for five years, the estimated ROI is 50% ($5 per year/$100).\nSome of the risks involved with using ROI are that ROI is calculated before taxes and that the stock price fluctuates with the economy.\nIf you need to calculate ROI for a company on a year-to-year basis, you will need to know the return on investment for each year.\nThe first important thing to know when dealing with financial data is that all data needs to be properly maintained. Data quality is important in that there is no reason to spend time and money on the process of data mining if the data lacks good quality. The process to be followed in maintaining high data quality is known as scrubbing. Scrubbing process or data scrubbing involves analyzing and cleaning the data for the purpose of improving its quality.\nScrubbing usually involves the use of rules to test data. These rules may involve testing for accuracy of the data value, validity of the data value, or even just ensuring that the data value does not misspell or fall outside of specifications.\nData scrubbing is critical for ensuring that the results of data mining are accurate. Without quality data, the results of data mining process will not be as accurate or meaningful. An efficient scrubbing process will eliminate the unnecessary or superfl", "evaluation": "exam"}

Coming up, we'll cover a wide range of topics. You'll learn about how data can empower our decisions, big and small; the difference between quantitative and qualitative analysis and when to use them; the pros and cons of different data visualization tools; what metrics are, and how analysts use them; and how to use mathematical thinking to connect the dots. To be honest, I'm still learning more about these things every day, and so will you! Like how quantitative and qualitative data can work together. In my role in finance, most of my work is quantitative, but recently I was working on a project that focused a lot on empathy and trust and that was really new for me. But we took those more qualitative things into account during analysis, and that really helped me understand how quantitative and qualitative data can come together to help us make powerful decisions. Now you're on your way to building your own data analyst toolkit. Before you know it, you'll be analyzing all kinds of data yourself and learning new things while you do it. But first, let's start small with the power of observation.\nHave you observed your data? What story did it tell you?

C\nspreadsheet basics\nSo you want to be a data analyst. Great! But to do that, you're gonna need some new skills, including knowing at least one data analytics tool inside and out. Think of it this way. You wouldn't become a chef and not learn how to use basic kitchen devices like a spatula, so you shouldn't jump straight into the game without learning to use your data tools of choice, as well. Spreadsheets are the best tools for getting started. They're versatile, easy to use, and you've already got one you're using. In this video, I'm going to walk through a spreadsheet, show you how to organize data, use filters, and a few more spreadsheet basics to get ready for advanced data analysis. \n \nIt's best to think of spreadsheets as just starting tools. As you learn more skills, you can start working with different apps that'll let you dig deeper into your data and organize even more complex sets at once. Let's run through a couple examples. A spreadsheet is great for making a quick table to keep you organized. Take a look at this one we made for a fictional online bookstore. We start with an example dataset containing some fictional information about customers. Each row in the table gives the date of the sale, the name of the customer, the number of books they purchased, the value of the books, and the address of the customer. This is a pretty basic dataset, easy to understand thanks to its headers, and organized in rows and in columns. We can expand this table to get more data to use for analysis, or simplify it to make things easier for us. But let's stick to this table for now. It meets the data management needs of this small business pretty well. But what if we were a larger business and needed to keep track of a lot more data at once, like more customer information and other things that might affect our sales? Let's look at a bigger example spreadsheet to get an idea. Think of a large retail company that has lots of locations all over the country. This company wants to keep track of revenue by department for two months. To do that, they've broken down each month into ten-day segments and created a schedule. So each time they collect or report revenue, they'll mark that on the appropriate day of the month", "evaluation": "exam"}

To address problems by breaking them down into manageable parts and examining each of these components.  Explanation: Structured thinking refers to the process of recognizing the current problem or situation. It allows the data analyst to organize available information, reveal gaps and opportunities, and finally to address problems by breaking them down into manageable parts, and examine each of the components. This systematic approach greatly improves efficiency.\nInstructions: These questions are based on an excerpt from the article titled \"The Importance of Structured Thinking in Data Analysis\" which is provided below. Read the excerpt carefully and analyze the statements given in those three questions. Select the best answer provided in the choices for each question.\nQuestions 1 and 2 are based on the following passage.\nStructured thinking is a process of analyzing and solving problems by breaking them down into manageable and actionable parts. Data analysts often use structured thinking to identify and organize key processes, tasks, and milestones, as well as to examine the relationships among them to achieve desired outcomes. In other words, structured thinking involves critical thinking and problem solving, which can lead to a better understanding of complex situations and more effective solutions. This method of organizing thoughts and information is highly advantageous for individuals and teams, as it helps clarify objectives, focus efforts, foster collaboration, and establish accountability.\nFirst, the passage states that \"Structured thinking is a process of analyzing and solving problems by breaking them down into manageable and actionable parts.\" [\\INST]\nA.

In the last video we talked about the importance of contextualizing data to remain objective. I'll continue with that same idea today. We should always make sure to avoid bias, which is the tendency to make unfair and unbalanced decisions, and is, by the way, a human element in business and politics. Not only can bias steer you away from the proper solution, but it affects trust in your organization, which is something you should be aware of and work to change. There's all kinds of bias. Some might seem minor and others obvious if you take the time to look. In the first part of this video, we'll focus on data bias. Data bias isn't related to the size or quality of your dataset. It's how you interpret the data based on internal, external, and psychological factors. One of the ways data bias affects results, is by using a single data set. In the real world, there are many data sets for each business question. But with multiple sources, it can be difficult and time-consuming to combine it into a whole. So, it's not uncommon for analysts to use only one. This happens a lot when you are dealing with a sample size. It's not easy to get access to all of the data, so what do analysts do? They take a subset of the population they suspect is similar to the whole population, conduct their analysis, and then reach conclusions based on that subset rather than the full population. If that subset isn't representative of the actual population, the data analysis will", "evaluation": "exam"}

Additionally, if you believe something may be missed, make sure to highlight important points.\n\nQuestion: Question 11. How can time constraints affect the quality of a data analysis? \nAnswer: Time constraints can affect the quality of a data analysis by limiting its depth. For example, if there is a strict timeline, data analysts are not able to ask new questions, explore different angles, or re-frame questions for better answers. By rushing your data analysis, you may not be able to come up with a complete story or the correct solution which can be very problematic. This will hinder any follow-up in the process.\n\nQuestion: Question 12. How can data visualization help a data analyst tell a good story?\nAnswer: Data visualization helps a data analyst tell a good story by communicating their results in a clear, succinct, and meaningful way. This can help stakeholders understand how to use and interpret the data to benefit the business.\n\nQuestion: Question 13. When you find yourself in conflict with a team member or stakeholder, how can you approach the issue with a collaboration mindset?\nAnswer: One way to approach an issue with a collaboration mindset is by taking a step back to understand how the situation came about.

This question is really about making sure you can frame your data analysis in a way that your audience or stakeholder can understand. Communicating with different audiences means thinking about if the information that you're presenting to them is clear, easy-to-understand, and answers their questions. This usually requires breaking down your data and analysis in a way that they can understand.

First, let's remind ourselves exactly what R is and why we might want to use it. R is both a programming language in an environment focused mainly on statistical analysis and graphics. It will be one of the main tools you use in this and following courses. R is downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network or CRAN. While this might be your first brush with it, we will be returning to CRAN time and time again when we install packages, so keep an eye out. Outside of this course, you may be asking yourself, \"Why should I use R?\" One reason to want to use R it's popularity. R is quickly becoming the standard language for statistical analysis. This makes R a great language to learn as the more popular software is, the quicker new functionality is developed, the more powerful it becomes and the better this support there is. Additionally, as you can see in this graph, knowing R is one of the top five languages asked for in data scientist's job postings. Another benefit to R it's cost. Free. This one is pretty self-explanatory. Every aspect of R is free to use, unlike some other stats packages you may have heard of EG, SAS or SPSS. So there is no cost barrier to using R. Yet another benefit is R's extensive functionality. R is a very versatile language. We've talked about its use in stats and in graphing. But it's used can be expanded in many different functions from making websites, making maps, using GIS data, analyzing language and even making these lectures and videos. Here we are showing a dot density map made in R of the population of Europe. Each dot is worth 50 people in Europe. For whatever task you have in mind, there is often a package available for download that does exactly that. The popularity of R is a huge benefit due to its community that has been built around R. Individuals have come together to make packages that add to the functionality of R, and more are being developed every day. Particularly, for people just getting started out with R, it's community is a huge benefit due to its popularity. There are multiple forums that have pages and pages dedicated to solving R problems.

Version Control\nNow that we've got a handle on our RStudio and projects, there are a few more things we want to set you up with before moving on to the other courses, understanding version control, installing Git, and linking Git with RStudio. In this lesson, we will give you a basic understanding of version control, first things first, what is version control? Version control is a system that records changes that are made to a file or a set of files over time. As you make edits, the version control system takes snapshots of your files and the changes and then saves those snapshots so you can refer, revert back to previous versions later if need be. If you've ever used the track changes feature in Microsoft Word, you have seen a rudimentary type of version control in which the changes to a file are tracked and you can either choose to keep those edits or revert to the original version. Version control software like Git are like a more sophisticated track changes in that, they are far more powerful and are capable of meticulously tracking successive changes on many files with potentially many people working simultaneously on the same groups of files. Hopefully, once you've mastered version control software, paper final final two actually finaldoc.docx will be a thing of the past for you. As we've seen in this example, without version control, you might be keeping multiple very similar copies of a file and this could be dangerous. You might start editing the wrong version not recognizing that the document labeled final two had been further edited to final and now all your new changes have been applied to the wrong file. Version control helps to solve this problem by keeping a single updated version of each file with a record of all previous versions and a record of exactly what changed between the versions which brings us to the next major benefit of version control. It keeps a record of all changes made to the file. This can be of great help when", "evaluation": "exam"}

You'll learn about data integrity and some risks you might run into as a data analyst. Data integrity is the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle. That might sound like a lot of qualities for the data to live up to. But trust me, it's worth it to check for them all before proceeding with your analysis. Data integrity can be compromised in lots of different ways. There's a chance data can be compromised every time it's replicated, transferred, or manipulated in any way.\nYou'll learn even more about data integrity when you take the data integrity video.\nIn the meantime, we'll introduce you to sampling, the process of choosing a subset from a population to be used for statistical analysis. \nA: CD: \nB: CD: \nC: CD: \nD: D: CD: \nIn this lesson, we learned that the data integrity can be compromised in many different ways.

Understanding how data integrity can be compromised will ensure you know the issues to look for when assessing your data. \nWe also discussed \"random sampling\". This concept can be thought of like taking a group of students at random and then evaluating those students on a topic. The group of students you choose is what you take and analyze. That group is the sample and would not include every single student in the school as you don't have the time or resources for that. Random sampling allows you to quickly and efficiently gain the same knowledge you would if you had taken the time to include every student. It just takes a \"random sample\" from the population. \nWe hope you now have a thorough understanding of all the different ways that data integrity can be compromised as well are able to recognize random sampling when it is present in your data analysis. \nQ: Question 3.

The higher the confidence level, the more likely that the data is reliable. The higher the confidence level, the lower the margin of error and vice versa. This is because using a higher level means the sample is more likely to capture all the points across the range. However, a high confidence level may result in a larger sample size which can be more time consuming or expensive, so it should be balanced with the resources available to meet the objective. Finally, if the sample is too small for the confidence level applied, then you won't get a significant difference in results when applying the data. Therefore, a high confidence level will make your data analysis with a sample more likely to be accurate and be more likely to give a statistically significant result.\nFurthermore, you can reduce the impact a particular data point, or a small amount of data, has on the sample in general by increasing the sample size or confidence level. This can help to remove any bias by ensuring that outliers are not overrepresented in the data. \\INST\n\\INST My answer is C, which is \nC. It increases the probability that the sample accurately reflects the greater population.\nAs you mentioned in the previous question, a high confidence level helps to ensure that the results are statistically significant. It also increases the probability that the data from the sample is accurately reflected in the population, meaning it provides an accurate picture of the larger group. To support my answer, a previous study has shown that when analyzing data, a higher confidence level typically corresponds to a smaller margin of error, resulting in more accurate data and ultimately leading to better decision-making and problem-solving. It also gives a greater sense of certainty that a significant difference between outcomes of a study or survey is real and not a chance finding. \\INST\n\\INST That is a great answer.

Is there a specific formula that needs to be used to calculate margin of error? \n[\\INST] Yes.\nExplanation: Margin of error is calculated through a formula that accounts for the standard deviation, the sample size, and the confidence level.\nQuestion 3. What is an example of an industry that would benefit from using sample sizes to conduct their studies?\n[\\INST] Pharmaceutical or medical research, especially studies involving human subjects.\nExplanation: Sample sizes are often used in pharmaceutical or medical research because it's not possible to experiment on the whole population, which would be ethically irresponsible, and impractical in terms of the number of people involved. Therefore, they use statistical sample sizes to get a representative sample of the population that they study.\nQuestion 4.

An alternative to TRIM is to apply trim on a text string using the RemoveExtraSpaces function. The syntax for the RemoveExtraSpaces function is equals RemoveExtraSpaces, open parenthesis, the text string to remove any extra spaces. Close the parenthesis. You'll then get a trimmed text string without any extra spaces. I'll add that extra-spaces can also be removed using the Find and Replace feature in a spreadsheet or by using the SUBSTITUTE function. The syntax for SUBSTITUTE is equals SUBSTITUTE, open parenthesis, the range, comma, the substring to be found, comma, the substring that replaces what has been found, comma, and an optional search beginning and end for those who want to search a part of a cell. Close the parenthesis.\nNow, you can apply a formula from A1 cell to A1:B12 and filter the product code column. The reason you add the formula to the entire range is because you want to see all of your data to get a full context. From there, you can see all the product names and the profit each one makes. To filter this column, select Product Code, then go to Data, choose Filter from the menu, and finally check mark Product Code. That will bring up filters for all your product codes in sheet one. Now, we'll uncheck the three codes you want to leave out. That will leave you with our two most profitable products.\nThen go back to the profits worksheet and click the filter icon.

Transforming data into a useful format for analysis. \nExplanation: B, C and D are handled by Data scientists, Data analysts and Data engineers.\nA, however, is the primary objective of a Data engineer: Giving data a reliable infrastructure\nTo ensure reliability, a data engineer can apply a plethora of techniques. One of the most common is data validation, which seeks to check the consistency of the collected and transformed data. Data validation is performed in many ways depending on the nature of the data involved.\nAnother common method data engineers use is data checking. It is the process of checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, and missing values, before using it for analysis. Data checking is a critical component of data analysis, as it can identify and remove any potentially biased or misleading data points. Data checking is also one of the easiest methods data engineers use to clean the data without coding. Data checking also includes identifying and removing any missing values, checking if the numbers are correct, sorting out data rows and columns, and detecting any duplicate entries. Another common method that data engineers use to clean the data is data cleansing. Data cleansing is used to remove or replace any dirty data. One of the most common methods used for data cleansing is known as fuzzy matching. This technique is used when an organization has multiple versions of a same entity in a database. For example, suppose a retail organization has multiple phone numbers for their customers in the database. Fuzzy matching is the process of identifying and merging multiple records of the same customer into a single record.\nAnother common data cleaning method, which data engineers use, is data parsing. Parsing, or separating data into components to understand it, is a critical part of any data analysis process. For example, if a data scientist wants to identify the locations of their clients, they can look for data that contain addresses like in this figure. In this kind of data, the address field is usually separated by comma. So if you want to separate the address field from the whole data, you can write a code to check where you should insert a space that would allow you to split the data.

Now that we know the difference between cleaning dirty data and some general data cleaning techniques, let's focus on data cleaning using SQL. Coming up we'll learn about the different data cleaning functions in spreadsheets and SQL and how SQL can be used to clean large data sets. I'll also show you how to develop some basic search queries for databases and how to apply basic SQL functions for transforming data and cleaning strings. Cleaning your data is the last step in the data analysis process before you can move on to the actual analysis, and SQL has a lot of great tools that can help you do that.\nBut before we start cleaning databases, we'll take a closer look at SQL and when to use it. We've talked about SQL a lot already. You've seen some databases and some basic functions in SQL, which means you already know some tools that you can use in SQL. And you've even seen how SQL can be used to process data. But now let's actually define SQL. SQL is a structured query language that analysts use to work with databases. Data analysts usually use SQL to deal with large datasets because it can handle huge amounts of data. And I mean trillions of rows. That's a lot of rows to wrap your head around. So let me give you an idea about how much data that really is. Imagine a data set that contains the names of all 500 million people in the world. It would take the average person 110 years to read all 10 million names. SQL can process this in seconds. Personally, I think that's pretty cool. Other tools like spreadsheets might take a really long time to process that much data, which is one of the main reasons data analysts choose to use SQL, when dealing with large datasets. This is another reason why data analysts choose SQL. It's a well-known standard within the community. The first time I used SQL to pull data from a real database was for my first job as a data analyst. I", "evaluation": "exam"}

How would you use gradient checking for a three-layer neural network with an MSE loss function?\nYou Answer: For a three-layer neural network, the process of gradient checking is to compute the gradients manually using the given loss function and compare them with the gradients computed by implementing backpropagation. To do this, we need to create a dummy input data and assign initial weights and biases to the neural network. Then, we can compute the gradients by hand using the given loss function by applying the chain rule of differentiation. We can then use these hand-computed gradients to compare them with the gradients computed by implementing backpropagation. If they match, it means we have implemented backpropagation correctly, and if they do not, then we must have a bug in our backpropagation implementation.\nA.

How can vanishing and exploding gradients cause a problem in deep neural networks?\nYou Answer: Vanishing and exploding gradients cause a problem in deep neural networks by preventing them from training successfully. In these cases, the gradients either become too small to be effective in training the network, or too large that they cannot be processed by the network. This can lead to the network failing to converge, becoming unstable, or producing unstable results. As a result, vanishing and exploding gradients can impede the success of deep neural networks and hinder their performance.\nA.

The vanishing exploding gradient is a big challenge in training deep learning models. So one strategy to solve it is to use smaller random weights when initializing the weights of the network. So that is a good strategy. Another strategy is to use different loss functions that penalize the networks for having large gradients at each layer. There are some techniques there.\nThank you for the explanation. I got insight on what's the real meaning of those strategies.\n[\\INST] You are welcome.\n \n\nQuestion: Question 8. Explain how you can implement gradient checking in your neural network code. [\\INST]\nAnswer: Shape the theta and the theta into single long vector. \nCompute the gradient of the cost function with respect to theta using backpropagation. Then compute the gradient of the cost function explicitly using finite difference approximation, taking small values like 10 to the minus 7 or 10 to the minus 8. And we can compare these two if they are close enough to each other \n[\\INST] Yes, you can do exactly as you explained.\nThank you.\nIn addition, this", "evaluation": "exam"}

I am trying to implement gradient checking as well because it can help you detect the mistakes you made without having to debug all the time. Just one question though. It is stated that theta is the parameters that make up the neural network, in what format is that? Is it the number of hidden neurons? Is it the weights of the synapses? I am confused with this.\n \nQuestion: You stated that we need to find the gradient in term of theta, how would you find this? [\\INST]\nAnswer: Gradient checking is a form of regression where you input parameters and then output the gradient. The formula that you will be using for gradient checking is stated in the answer. \\[\\nabla_{\\theta}j\\] = \\[\\frac{\\nabla_{w}j + \\nabla_{b}j}{L}\\] this formula will give you the gradient in term of the parameter. Theta here is the parameter which you want to calculate the gradient of J wrt to. It will give you the result you want. \\[\\nabla_{w}j\\] is the gradients of W which you can find by back propagation like usual, \\[\\nabla_{b}j\\] is the gradient of bias which also can be found by the usual back propagation \\[\\frac{1}{L}\\] is the inverse number of layers, this is for normalization of the value (as theta is the flattened vector).\nInstead of outputting the gradient of J, you output the parameters Theta. After that, you can find the gradient by back propagation (as shown in the tutorial). Then you compare the two values. If they are close to each other, then your backpropagation algorithm is working correctly. If the value is more than about 1e-5, it may mean you have some errors in your backpropagation, because the value is too big.\nIf this is the same format of question:\n", "evaluation": "exam"}

This can mean the model is trying to fit noise instead of actual patterns since it is having to learn more complex patterns to fit the data better. A common method to address this is to add regularisation which gives the model a penalty that reduces the magnitude of the weight values of the model.
