Different rules apply to different types of measures, such as reported bills and resolutions, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules. Under House rules, draft committee reports and unreported bills and joint resolutions are considered available if they are publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration. Conference committee reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available if they are in electronic form at such a location. The House rule exempts several kinds of measures, including resolutions reported by the Rules Committee. Measures and other matters reported by committees may not be considered on the House floor until a draft of the committee report on the matter has been available for at least 72 hours. The House has several means for waiving its rules when it wishes to act expeditiously, such as by unanimous consent, two-thirds vote, or special rules reported from the Rules Committee. The House can also waive availability requirements by a simple majority. If a majority of the House desires to do so, the House can vote on a measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to Members. The House usually does this by agreeing to two special rules, as explained above. The Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives the 72-hour availability requirement for bills, resolutions, or conference reports. A rule only waiving the availability requirement can be presented and called up on the same day. Special rules often set the terms for considering a measure as well. A special rule for the consideration of a measure might waive the 72-hour availability requirement but also structure the amending process. Such a rule would be required to lie over for one legislative day (unless this requirement is waived by a two-thirds vote). To waive the one-day layover requirement of Rule XIII, clause 6(a), for a special rule, the Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives this requirement. The rule providing this waiver is subject to the same one-day layover requirement.

In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015).

Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the confidence of predictions in a regression setting. The approach starts from the standard modelling assuming iid samples from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variances and places evidential priors. This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors formalize the problem of uncertainty estimation in terms of learning evidential distributions, which are distributions over the parameters of a likelihood function that captures the uncertainty in the data. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach on a one-dimensional toy regression task and on real-world regression tasks, including depth estimation.\n\nThe authors propose a new loss function for training neural networks that incorporates both the model evidence and the evidential regularizer. The model evidence is the probability of observing the data given the model's parameters, and the evidential regularizer is a term that encourages the model to assign high uncertainty to out-of-distribution data. The authors also propose a new method for estimating the aleatoric uncertainty of a model's predictions, which is based on the variance of the model's predictions.\n\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the performance of the proposed approach on a variety of regression tasks. The authors show that their approach outperforms other methods for uncertainty estimation, including MC-dropout, model ensembles, and Bayesian methods. They also demonstrate that their approach can recover the underlying aleatoric uncertainty of a model's predictions, even on synthetic data with known noise.\n\nOne potential question that arises from the paper is how well the proposed approach generalizes to other types of regression tasks. The paper primarily focuses on regression tasks, but it would be interesting to see how well the approach performs on other types of problems, such as classification or clustering.\n\nAnother potential question is how well the proposed approach scales to more complex models and datasets. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on relatively simple models and datasets, but it would be interesting to see how well the approach performs on more complex models and datasets.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and effective approach for training neural networks to estimate uncertainty in their predictions. The authors provide a thorough analysis of the performance of the proposed approach on a variety of regression tasks, and their results suggest that the approach is well-suited for use in a variety of applications.", "evaluation": "human"}
