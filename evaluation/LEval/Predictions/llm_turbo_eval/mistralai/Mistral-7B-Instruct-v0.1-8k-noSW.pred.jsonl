The House can also waive availability requirements by a simple majority. If a majority of the House desires to do so, the House can vote on a measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to Members. The House usually does this by agreeing to two special rules, as explained above. The Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives the 72-hour availability requirement for bills, resolutions, or conference reports. A rule only waiving the availability requirement can be presented and called up on the same day. Special rules often set the terms for considering a measure as well. A special rule for the consideration of a measure might waive the 72-hour availability requirement but also structure the amending process.

He was raised in a middle-class Jewish family and received a traditional Jewish education. However, he was also exposed to German literature and culture, which had a profound influence on his thinking and writing.\n\nIn 1880, Herzl moved to Vienna, Austria, where he studied law and became a lawyer. He was also an active member of a student society and a dueling fraternity. During this time, he became increasingly interested in the Jewish question, which refers to the social, political, and cultural problems faced by Jews in Europe.\n\nIn 1881, Herzl read Eugen D\u00fchring's book \"The Jewish Problem as a Problem of Race, Morals and Culture,\" which argued that the Jewish question was a purely racial question and that the Jewish race was without any worth whatsoever. This book had a profound impact on Herzl and led him to become more deeply involved in the Jewish question.\n\nIn 1884, Herzl was admitted to the bar in Vienna and began practicing law. He was soon transferred to the court of Salzburg, where he continued to practice law until 1889. During this time, he continued to write and publish articles and essays on various topics, including politics, religion, and literature.\n\nIn 1889, Herzl published \"The Jewish State,\" which is considered one of the most important works of Zionism. The pamphlet outlined Herzl's vision of a Jewish homeland in Palestine and his plan for achieving it. It was widely read and discussed in the Jewish community and beyond, and is considered a seminal work in the history of Zionism.\n\nHerzl continued to write and publish works on various topics throughout his life.

Recent approaches for this task either apply a fixed policy on a state-of-the art Transformer model, or a learnable monotonic attention on a weaker recurrent neural network-based structure.

We also introduce two novel and interpretable approaches for latency control that are specifically designed for multiple attention heads. We apply MMA to the simultaneous machine translation task and demonstrate better latency-quality tradeoffs compared to MILk, the previous state-of-the-art approach. We analyze how the latency controls affect the attention span and we study the relationship between the speed of a head and the layer it belongs to. Finally, we motivate the introduction of our model by analyzing the effect of the number of decoder layers and heads on quality and latency.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution.

A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008).
