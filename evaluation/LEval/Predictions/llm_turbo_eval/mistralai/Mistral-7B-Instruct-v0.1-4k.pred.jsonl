Different rules apply to different types of measures, such as reported bills and resolutions, unreported bills and joint resolutions, conference committee reports, and special rules. Under House rules, draft committee reports and unreported bills and joint resolutions are considered available if they are publicly available in electronic form at a location designated by the Committee on House Administration. Conference committee reports and accompanying joint explanatory statements are also considered available if they are in electronic form at such a location. The House rule exempts several kinds of measures, including resolutions reported by the Rules Committee. Measures and other matters reported by committees may not be considered on the House floor until a draft of the committee report on the matter has been available for at least 72 hours. The House has several means for waiving its rules when it wishes to act expeditiously, such as by unanimous consent, two-thirds vote, or special rules reported from the Rules Committee. The House can also waive availability requirements by a simple majority. If a majority of the House desires to do so, the House can vote on a measure the same calendar day that the text was made available to Members. The House usually does this by agreeing to two special rules, as explained above. The Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives the 72-hour availability requirement for bills, resolutions, or conference reports. A rule only waiving the availability requirement can be presented and called up on the same day. Special rules often set the terms for considering a measure as well. A special rule for the consideration of a measure might waive the 72-hour availability requirement but also structure the amending process. Such a rule would be required to lie over for one legislative day (unless this requirement is waived by a two-thirds vote). To waive the one-day layover requirement of Rule XIII, clause 6(a), for a special rule, the Rules Committee may report a special rule that waives this requirement. The rule providing this waiver is subject to the same one-day layover requirement.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

This opens the door to online applications with fully integrated uncertainty estimates. \n\nPros:\n1.\tNovel approach to regression (a similar work has been published at NeurIPS last year for classification [3]), but the extension of the work to regression is important.\n2.\tThe experimental results show consistent improvement in performance over a wide base of benchmarks, scales to large vision problems and behaves robustly against adversarial examples.\n3.\tThe presentation of the paper is overall nice, and the Figures are very useful to the general comprehension of the article.\nCons:\n1.\tThe theory of evidence, which is not widely known in the ML community, is not clearly introduced. \nI think that the authors should consider adding a section similar to Section 3 of Sensoy et al. [3] should be considered. Currently, the only step explaining the evidential approach that I found was in section 3.1, in a very small paragraph (between \u201cthe mean of [\u2026] to \\lambda + 2\\alpha.\u201d). I believe that the article would greatly benefit from a more thorough introduction of concepts linked to the theory of evidence.\n2.\tThe authors briefly mention that KL is not well defined between some NIG distributions (p.5) and propose a custom evidence regularizer, but there\u2019s very little insight given on how this connects to/departs from the ELBO approach. \n\nOther comments/questions:\n1.\t(p.1)  I\u2019m not sure to fully understand what\u2019s meant by higher-order/lower-order distributions, could you clarify?\n2.\t(p.3) In section 3.1, the term in the total evidence \\phi_j is not defined.\n3.\t(p.3) Could you comment on the implications of assuming that the estimated distribution can be factorized? \n4.\t(p.4) Could you comment on the difference that there is between NLL_ML and NLL_SOS from a modelling perspective?\n5.\t(p.4) The ELBO loss (6) is unclearly defined, and not connected to the direct context. I would suggest moving this to the section 3.3, where the prior p(\\theta) used in eq. (6) is actually defined.\n\nSpelling & typos:\n-\t(p.4) There are several typos in equation (8), where tau should be replaced with 1/\\sigma^2. \n-\t(p.8) In the last sentence, there is \u201cntwork\u201d instead of network.\n-\t(p.9) There is a typo in the name of J\u00f8sang in the references. \n-\t(p.10) In equation (13), due to the change of variable, there should be a \n-(1/\\tau^2) added;  \n-\t(p.10) In equation (14), the \\exp(-\\lambda*\\pi*(\u2026)) should be replaced with \\exp(-\\lambda*\\tau*(\u2026)). \n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors use a conjugate prior distribution on the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution to model the data and place a higher-order prior distribution over the learned parameters governing the distribution from which the observations are drawn. This allows them to successfully model the uncertainty of their data, also known as the aleatoric uncertainty. However, their model remains oblivious to the predictive model or epistemic uncertainty.\n\nThe paper presents a problem setup where the observed targets, yi, are drawn i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and variance (\u00b5, \u03c32), which the authors seek to probabilistically estimate. They model this by placing a conjugate prior distribution on (\u00b5, \u03c32). If they assume their observations are drawn from a Gaussian, this leads to placing a Gaussian prior on their unknown mean and an Inverse-Gamma prior on their unknown variance. The authors define the total evidence, \u03a6, of their evidential distributions as the sum of all inferred virtual-observations counts.\n\nThe paper then describes their approach for learning a model to output the hyperparameters of this higher-order, evidential distribution, given an input. They structure the learning objective into two distinct parts: (1) acquiring or maximizing model evidence in support of their observations and (2) minimizing evidence or inflating uncertainty when the prediction is wrong. At a high level, they can think of (1) as a way of fitting their data to the evidential model while (2) enforces a prior to inflate their uncertainty estimates.\n\nThe authors use neural networks to infer the hyperparameters of this higher-order, evidential distribution, given an input. This approach presents several distinct advantages compared to prior work. First, their method enables simultaneous learning of the desired regression task, along with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimation, built in, by enforcing evidential priors. Second, since the evidential prior is a higher-order N.I.G. distribution, the maximum likelihood Gaussian can be computed analytically from the expected values of the (\u00b5, \u03c32) parameters, without the need for sampling. Third, they can effectively estimate the ep", "evaluation": "human"}
