We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

A primer: Unions: Since 1977, unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts, but not political ones. Now California teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political. \"It could set the stage for a Citizens United-style reconsideration in the area of union dues,\" a lawyer says. Affirmative Action: Abigail Fisher says that being white played a role in the University of Texas denying her admission back in 2008. The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs. The death penalty: Justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Georgia, and Florida, the Wall Street Journal reports.

The case is being brought by a group of teachers who argue that forcing them to pay union dues violates their First Amendment rights. The conservative justices on the court have not been friendly to unions in the past, and it is unclear how they will resolve this case.\n\nAnother important case is Abigail Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, which challenges the constitutionality of the university's affirmative action program. The case was brought by a rejected applicant who contends that she was rejected because of her race. The last time the case went before the high court, the justices told the 5th Circuit that affirmative action must be handled with \"strict scrutiny,\" but the decision did not suggest it was automatically unconstitutional. Justice Elena Kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general.\n\nA third important case is Evenwel v. Abbott, which challenges the meaning of \"one person, one vote.\" The case presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people. If immigrants (both illegal and legal) as well as children are left out of the count, it could tilt the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters.\n\nFinally, several religious-affiliated schools and institutions have filed lawsuits challenging the contraception requirement under Obamacare.

The grips are also designed to reduce the risk of tendinitis by providing a different muscle strategy during shoveling. The grips are designed to reduce the trunk flexion angle, which in turn reduces the effort from the extensor muscles of the hip and back. The grips are also designed to reduce the moment arm of the load relative to the body's axes of rotation, which in turn reduces the tendency of the load to rotate downward. The grips are also designed to reduce the potential for blister formation by reducing the magnitude of skin surface shear. The grips are available in two main types: D-grip and T-grip.

Universities are often susceptible to the NIC's pressure to recruit freshmen because Greek life appeals to applicants and many alumni donors remain loyal to their fraternities. Only 80 of about 800 U.S. campuses with fraternities defer recruiting, according to the conference.\n\nThe article also discusses the efforts of fraternities to protect students, including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators. However, some critics argue that keeping out freshmen merely puts a \"Band-Aid\" on a broader campus problem and deprives freshmen of opportunities at fraternities for leadership, career networking, and charitable work.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

At least seven states have now declared a state of emergency, and hundreds of flights are being canceled. Gas stations are running out of fuel and ATMs have been emptied of cash as Americans hit the road for a bumper-to-bumper trip out of Irene's angry path. The Category 3 storm is expected to hit the Southeast sometime tomorrow, and hundreds of thousands of residents have been ordered out of their homes in three North Carolina counties. Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The storm is expected to hit the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Friday night and continue northwards, with the worst of the weather expected in Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia on Saturday and Sunday. The storm is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surges to the affected areas.\n\nGovernments in the affected states have declared a state of emergency and many events, including the dedication of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington D.C., have been postponed. The storm is expected to cause significant damage to infrastructure and homes, and power outages are likely to occur.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for much of the D.C. area, and Amtrak has canceled train service in the region. Airlines have also announced flight cancellations and delays. Many vacationers have been forced to evacuate from the affected areas, and colleges have advised students to delay their arrival.\n\nThe storm is expected to be particularly dangerous for low-lying areas, and there is a risk of flooding and wind-driven damage. The authorities are taking steps to prepare for the storm, including stockpiling supplies and deploying emergency services.\n\nOverall, Hurricane Irene poses a significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, and it is important for residents to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
