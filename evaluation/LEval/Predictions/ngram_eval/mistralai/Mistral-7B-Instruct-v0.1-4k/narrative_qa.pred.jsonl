I found that he was not there.\n\nThe book was a thorough and brilliantly written work. The omission of Soames's name in the index was a deadlier record of his failure to impress himself on his decade.\n\nSoames had failed so piteously that he was not even mentioned in the book. This was a cruel blow to his ego and a testament to his lack of success.\n\nDespite this, I felt compelled to write about Soames. I wanted to pay tribute to his memory and to honor his contributions to literature, even if they were not widely recognized during his lifetime.\n\nSoames was a unique individual who stood out from the crowd. He was a writer who was ahead of his time, and his ideas and concepts were often misunderstood and dismissed by his contemporaries.\n\nDespite this, Soames persevered and continued to write, even in the face of criticism and rejection. He was a true artist who was driven by his passion for literature and his desire to express his ideas and thoughts.\n\nSoames's legacy is one of perseverance and dedication. He was a writer who refused to give up, even when the odds were stacked against him. His work may not have been widely recognized during his lifetime, but it will continue to inspire and influence future generations of writers.\n\nIn conclusion, Enoch Soames was a remarkable individual who made a significant contribution to the literature of the eighteen-nineties.

It was as I feared: he was not there. But everybody\nelse was. Many writers whom I had quite forgotten, or remembered but\nfaintly, lived again for me, they and their work, in Mr. Holbrook\nJackson's pages. The book was as thorough as it was brilliantly\nwritten. And thus the omission found by me was an all the deadlier\nrecord of poor Soames's failure to impress himself on his decade. I dare say I am the only person who noticed the omission. Soames had\nfailed so piteously as all that! Nor is there a counterpoise in the\nthought that if he had had some measure of success he might have\npassed, like those others, out of my mind, to return only at the\nhistorian's beck. It is true that had his gifts, such as they were,\nbeen acknowledged in his lifetime, he would never have made the bargain\nI saw him make--that strange bargain whose results have kept him always\nin the foreground of my memory. Not my compassion, however, impels me to write of him. For his sake, poor fellow, I should be inclined to keep my pen out of the ink. It is ill to deride the dead. And how can I write about Enoch Soames without making him ridiculous? Or, rather, how am I to hush up the horrid fact that he WAS ridiculous? I shall not be able to do that. Yet, sooner or later, write about him I must. In the summer term of '93 a bolt from the blue flashed down on Oxford. It drove deep; it hurtlingly embedded itself in the soil. Dons and undergraduates stood around, rather pale, discussing nothing but it. Wherefrom came it, this meteorite? From Paris. Its name? Will Rothenstein. Its aim?
