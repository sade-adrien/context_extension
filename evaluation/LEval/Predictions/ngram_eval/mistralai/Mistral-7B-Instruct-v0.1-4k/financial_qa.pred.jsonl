High-speed optical interconnects are also required to transport massive amounts of data locally and over the few kilometers between enterprise networks, servers, datacenters, and the optical network. That demand for high performance coupled with the need to reduce total cost of ownership drives the need for integrated photonics, ICs, and packaging solutions. Oclaro will target two major growth markets for line side components and transceivers: next generation 100G WDM transmission with coherent detection and 10G medium to long reach regional transmission feeding the core and metro optical network. In that business, Oclaro will be highly differentiated through its end-to-end vertical integration. Its tunable laser platform and integrated functionality at the chip level for long-haul performance.
