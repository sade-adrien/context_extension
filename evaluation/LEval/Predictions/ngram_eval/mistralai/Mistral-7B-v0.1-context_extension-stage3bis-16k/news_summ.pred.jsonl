We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

This acquisition was announced on September 3, 2013 and resulted in a drastic change in Microsoft's mobile device strategy. Here is a summary of the Microsoft-Nokia deal.\n1. Rationale:\nMicrosoft-Nokia collaboration was aimed at creating a competitive ecosystem across devices, services, and applications to compete with the two major players in the smartphone market - Apple and Google. The acquisition's rationale was to create a vertically-integrated company that would operate more like Apple, but without the same degree of control over hardware and software as Apple's iOS does.\n2. Impact on Windows Phone and Hardware:\nWith the acquisition of Nokia, Microsoft gained a large portfolio of patents and intellectual property, as well as a mobile ecosystem of devices and services that could complement the strengths of Microsoft's mobile software. Microsoft planned to develop new high-end and mid-range smartphones and make Windows Phone devices more affordable, thus expanding its market share in the smartphone industry.\n3. Significance: \nThe Microsoft-Nokia deal was one of the largest technology acquisitions, with a value of $7.2 billion, making it the largest mobile handset buyout of all time. The deal signaled Microsoft\u2019s intention to regroup in the mobile market after its struggles with the Windows Mobile and Windows Phone operating systems.\n4. Market Share:\nThe Microsoft-Nokia deal provided a significant boost to Microsoft's market share in the smartphone sector. As of 2015, Nokia held 33.6% of the mobile phone market in emerging markets and was ranked second in the global smartphone market with a 6% market share. However, Microsoft's overall smartphone market share has been declining steadily over the years.\n5. Strategy:\nThe deal allowed Microsoft to develop and build its own hardware devices while keeping its core software and services business. The strategy was aimed at providing a more streamlined user experience, which may have been challenging previously with third-party device partners.\nThe Microsoft-Nokia merger signified Microsoft\u2019s shift towards a more vertically integrated approach in the mobile market, which was designed to align its devices and", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs.

In an extensive Atlantic piece, Caitlin Flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors. As Bloomberg reported, 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005, a fact \"that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries, assaults, and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses,\" writes Flanagan. She chronicles a few incidents, from a freshman girl's heinous rape at Wesleyan University to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at Marshall University\u2014and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it, and later sued Alpha Tau Omega for his injuries. To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules. That means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills, and parents' homeowners insurance often pays settlements. So why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist? Largely because fraternity dorms save schools \"untold millions of dollars\" in housing, writes Flanagan, and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities. To be fair, advocates also describe the positives\u2014like increased confidence, brotherhood, and leadership training.

They have grown to be part of the Greek-lettering system for social groups on college campuses. There are various types of fraternities, but the most prominent ones are the fraternity houses or groups of students who live together in a house. One reason fraternity houses are particularly popular among college students is that they provide a sense of community and camaraderie that dormitories cannot offer. However, the byondafraternity.com, a website dedicated to Greek lettering, highlights the fact that fraternity houses have a reputation for risky behavior and negative consequences. Thus, the question of whether they are worth it or not is subject to debate. One argument in favor of fraternity houses is that they provide a sense of community that can be hard to find in other types of living arrangements. It is believed that fraternities help students connect with their peers and build relationships that can last a lifetime. Additionally, living in a fraternity house creates a space for students to socialize, network, and engage in academic support systems. On the other hand, there have been many cases of fraternity houses being associated with hazing, alcohol abuse, and sexual assault. These incidents have led to numerous lawsuits and negative publicity for fraternities. There is also the matter of costs. Fraternity houses often require that students pay dues and expenses for monthly rent, food, parties, and more. Additionally, they require a level of dedication and commitment that not all students can afford. Despite all the risks and costs involved, many students still choose to live in fraternity houses due to the sense of community and personal growth they provide. It is important for students to carefully weigh all the pros and cons before making a decision and to consider all their options to ensure that they are making the best choice for their needs.[/INST] In conclusion, based on the above information, it is clear that fraternity houses can provide various benefits, but also come with a lot of risks and costs.

Norfolk, Va., is also ordering residents to evacuate, and Washington, DC, has been forced to postpone Sunday's planned MLK Memorial dedication. \"This is a very, very serious situation,\" a spokeswoman for Dare County told ABC News. \"We have not seen anything like this in the lifetimes of most our residents. Once the storm hits, it will be very difficult to respond to distress calls.\" Irene is some 700 miles wide now and moving at a slow 12mph, which means it can wreak extensive damage in a region over a long period of time; it could cause up to $13.9 billion in damage on the East Coast. The storm is expected to barrel into New York City on Sunday, packing winds of up to 90mph. New Jersey communities are already being evacuated, and hundreds of street fairs have been canceled and elder care facilities and hospitals in low-lying area will be evacuated in New York today. NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg says residents in low-lying parts of the city should get out today as the transit system is planned to be shut down tomorrow.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.
