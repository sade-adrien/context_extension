The following is an abstract that incorporates the most important aspects of the paper:\nThis paper proposes a novel method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, called SVD-RND (SVD-based Random Network Distillation). SVD-RND utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) to generate blurred images as adversarial examples to train a predictor network. The predictor network is optimized to minimize the difference between the blurred image and the original image, resulting in a model that detects the blurred image as out-of-distribution.\nSVD-RND is tested on various OOD problems, including CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN, TinyImageNet vs. (SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100), and CelebA vs. (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100). SVD-RND shows improved performance compared to conventional deep generative models in domains where the baseline models perform poorly. Moreover, SVD-RND is effective in domains with moderate performance from conventional deep generative models.\nSVD-RND can be further enhanced by combining it with other techniques, such as rotation and vertical translation. Overall, SVD-RND shows robust OOD detection performance in various domains. ", "evaluation": "rouge"}

OOD Detection: Majority of OOD detection methods rely on a reconstruction error and representation learning. (Ruff et al., 2018) trained a deep neural network to map data into a minimum volume hypersphere. Generative probabilistic novelty detection (GPND) (Pidhorskyi et al., 2018) employed the distance to the latent data manifold as the confidence measure and trained the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model the manifold. Deep generative models are widely employed for latent space modeling in OOD detection (Zenati et al., 2018; Sabokrou et al., 2018). However, a recent paper by Nalisnick et al. (2019) discovered that popular deep generative models, such as variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma et al., 2014) or GLOW (Kingma et al., 2018), fail to detect simple OOD. While adversarially trained generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or AAE, are not discussed in Nalisnick et al.

We first discuss the previous works related to OOD detection using deep generative models, followed by the related works on novelty detection and the method of adversarial example generation.\nThe idea of discriminant adversarial training was introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014) and Mao et al. (2017) to enhance the generalization ability and prevent the overfitting of generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014). Later, Burda et al. (2019) proposed RND (Random Network Distillation), where the generator learns to minimize the distance between the in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. In our main experiments, we employ RND as the base OOD detection models.\nNalisnick et al. (2019) compared the performance of several novelty detection schemes and showed that the methods based on deep generative models often show lower accuracies than methods based on classifiers. The method of typicality was proposed as a way to discriminate between the generative model for the training data and the generative model for the OOD data (Nalisnick et al., 2019). In this paper, we evaluate SVD-RND against these conventional OOD detection models.\nErdogdu et al. (2020) studied the method for image perturbations that cause the generative model to generate low confidence scores. Erdogdu et al. (2020) proposed a method that adds random noise with Gaussian distribution to the image pixel values which the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) generate low confidence scores.\nDCT-RND was firstly proposed by Zhang et al. (2019), who showed that DCT-RND outperforms SVD-RND. This finding is an interesting topic that needs to be further investigated in future work. Zhang et al.

They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important. I am happy to increase my score if the experiments suggests are added to the work.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors propose a new method, called SVD-RND, which is based on a random network distillation approach and is designed to discriminate the original and the blurred versions of the training data. They show that the proposed method outperforms conventional baselines on various challenging domains, including CIFAR-10 vs. SVHN and CIFAR-10 vs. TinyImageNet. Furthermore, they demonstrate that their method can be used in combination with geometric transformations to further improve the performance on out-of-distribution detection.\nHowever, some limitations of the method could be addressed. For instance, the authors rely on SVD to generate adversarial examples, which requires additional computation. Besides, they use blurring as a way to generate adversarial examples, which may not necessarily be the most representative examples of real-world OOD data.\nAdditionally, the authors could also provide information about how they compute the geometric transformations used in their method, and provide more thorough benchmarking studies.\nOverall, the authors present a promising approach to novelty detection that could be further improved in future research.", "evaluation": "rouge"}

(2014), substantial progress has been done to improve the accuracy of supervised depth estimation from monocular images, including the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Li et al., 2015), joint optimization of surface normals (Qi et al., 2018), fusion of multiple depth maps (Lee et al., 2018), and ordinal classification (Fu et al., 2018). Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos. Rapid progress in terms of architectures and objective functions (Yin & Shi, 2018; Mahjourian et al., 2018; Casser et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Klodt & Vedaldi, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) have since then turned monocular depth estimation into one of the most successful applications of self-supervised learning, even outperforming supervised methods (Guizilini et al., 2019). The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

(2016); Panageas and Piliouras (2017), ensure convergence to global minimum. Many works, both classic (e.g. Baldi and Hornik (1989)) and recent (e.g. Choromanska et al. (2015); Kawaguchi (2016); Hardt and Ma (2016); Soudry and Carmon (2016); Haeffele and Vidal (2017); Nguyen and Hein (2017); Safran and Shamir (2018); Nguyen and Hein (2018); Laurent and Brecht (2018)), have focused on the validity of these properties in different deep learning settings. Nonetheless, to our knowledge,\n9https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/ examples/tutorials/mnist\n10As opposed to the dataset used in our experiments with linear networks, measuring the training loss with MNIST is non-trivial computationally (involves passing through 60K examples). Therefore, rather than continuously polling training loss until it reaches a certain threshold, in this experiment we chose to evaluate speed of convergence by measuring the training loss once after a predetermined number of iterations. the success of landscape-driven analyses in formally proving convergence to global minimum for a gradient-based algorithm, has thus far been limited to shallow (two layer) models only (e.g. Ge et al. (2016); Du and Lee (2018); Du et al. (2018a)). An alternative to the landscape approach is a direct analysis of the trajectories taken by the optimizer.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors prove linear convergence rate if (1) the network dimensions are big enough so that the full product can have full rank, (2) the singular values of each weight matrices are approximately the same, (3) the initialized point is \u201cclose enough\u201d to the target.\n\nMy main concern about the study of GD on linear neural network is whether we really get any \u201cbenefit\u201d or \u201cacceleration\u201d from depth, i.e., is GD on linear neural nets any faster than GD on linear models. It\u2019s been shown that we get acceleration in some cases (e.g., $\\ell_p$ regression when $p>2$ [Arora et al. 18\u2019]), but some other results (e.g., [Shamir 18\u2019] mentioned in Section 5) show that GD on linear neural nets (when weight matrices are all scalar) suffer exponential (in depth) increase in convergence time at near zero region, due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible. It will be an interesting future work to clearly delineate the boundary between convergence and non-convergence.\n\n* In Thm 2 and Claim 3, what happens if dimension $d_0$ is smaller? What is the reason that you had to restrict it to high dimension? Is it due to high variance with few samples?\n\n* In Thm 2, constants $d\u2019_0$ and $a$ hide the dependence of the result on p, but I would suggest stating the dependence of those parameters on p, and also dependence on other parameters such as N.\n\n* In Section 5, there is a statement \u201cThis negative result, a theoretical manifestation of the \u201cvanishing gradient problem\u201d, is circumvented by balanced initialization.\u201d Can you elaborate more on that?

The paper presents an analysis of the behavior of gradient descent for deep linear neural networks trained to minimize an F loss over whitened data. The authors derive a convergence rate result for gradient descent, showing that it can produce a solution with cost at most the original cost plus a constant that is linear in the depth of the network.\nFirst, I would suggest further work on the numerical simulations and implementations used in the paper. As the authors note, gradient descent can be sensitive to initialization and hyperparameter settings, and it would be helpful to see how the performance of gradient descent depends on these factors in practice. Additionally, in the current paper, the simulations are performed without activation functions, which can result in different behavior on non-linear neural networks. It would be interesting to see an implementation of the paper\u2019s results on modern, non-linear neural networks.\nNext, I would suggest investigating other loss functions for linear neural networks. The authors limit themselves to the F loss and do not explore other popular loss functions such as cross-entropy or triplet loss. Moreover, the F loss is only applicable to linear neural networks, so it would be helpful to explore different loss functions and how they perform on non-linear neural networks.\nI would also suggest investigation of different initialization methods. In the current paper, the authors use random initialization of the weights by layer-wise independent Gaussian random variables with zero mean. However, other methods such as He initialization or Xaiver initialization have been shown to perform better in practice. It would be helpful to see how these methods affect the analysis of the paper.\nFinally, I would suggest expanding the application of the convergence analysis to larger, more complex linear neural networks. The current paper focuses on fairly small networks, and it would be interesting to see how the convergence rate results generalize to larger networks with more layers and more nodes.\nOverall, the paper provides a helpful mathematical analysis of gradient descent for deep linear neural networks, and I think the results could provide a useful theoretical understanding of how gradient descent performs in various circumstances.

The VNQ training procedure consists of training with the ELBO under a mean-field approximation of the posterior and imposing a clipping boundary to ensure that weights do not get stuck at trainable boundaries, and gradient stopping to prevent clipped weights from being stuck at the trainable boundaries. The paper then demonstrates VNQ's effectiveness on LeNet-5 on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and DenseNet on CIFAR-10.\nThe paper introduces a quantizing prior, based on a log-uniform prior, as a means of inducing sparsity in the distribution over weights. The prior assigns a 0 weight to \u03b8 values that fall within a variance band \u03c3/ \u221a T\u03b1 , where \u03b1 = exp(log \u03c32). After training using the ELBO with VNQ, pruning is done by thresholding \u03b1 such that only weights with a large variance and a mean \u03b8 that is close to 0 are pruned, which is equivalent to assigning a hard \"0\" to the weights. Finally, quantization is done by assigning each weight the quantization value corresponding to the maximum posterior likelihood under the learned posterior.\nA The paper demonstrates VNQ's effectiveness on LeNet-5 on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset and DenseNet on CIFAR-10. On MNIST, VNQ achieves good accuracy after pruning and quantizing the network by approximately 85%. On CIFAR-10, VNQ achieves similar results after pruning and quantizing the network. The paper also shows that VNQ can be reused for arbitrary codebooks and has a differentiable KL approximation that is reasonably good on the relevant range of \u03b8 and \u03c3 values.\nOverall, the paper presents a new technique for preparing a neural network for post-training quantization with good accuracy and without requiring subsequent fine-tuning.

In contrast, we use a quantizing prior, leading to a multi-modal posterior suitable for fewbit quantization and pruning. Bayesian Compression and Structured Bayesian Pruning (Louizos et al., 2017; Neklyudov et al., 2017) extend Sparse VD to prune whole neurons or filters via groupsparsity constraints. Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al. (2017) learn dropout rates by using a continuous relaxation of dropout\u2019s discrete masks (via the concrete distribution). The authors learn layer-wise dropout rates, which does not allow for dropout-rate-based pruning.

Also, they should investigate how the use of different KL approximation affects the accuracy of the final model.\nConcerning the experimental settings, the authors did not provide any comparisons with other methods and reported results only for 8-bit and 3-bit quantization. 32-bit, 16-bit, and even 8-bit float-point formats are widely used in recent years, mainly for hardware-efficient inference.

This paper proposes to apply the jackknife method for bias reduction to this estimation problem directly, rather than iteratively as previously. This generalizes the existing jackknife variational inference method. Experiments on variational autoencoders trained on MNIST show that our method reduces biases in evidence estimates in comparison to the variational lower-bound objective. These lower biases translate into more accurate estimation of the true log-likelihood, and better generalization, for model selection. \nIntroduction Variational inference (VI) is a generic method for inferring latent variables from data and has found wide-spread application in the machine learning field. An early incarnation of variational inference is the evidence lower-bound (ELBO) variational objective of Mackay (1992),\n\u2212L ( \u2113 p) (xi) zi ~ N(xi , \u03c3 2 ) \u2113 log (\u2212\u03c3 2 /2\u03c0) \u2212 1 2 (xi \u2212 )2 \u2212 H ( z) . (1)\nThe ELBO lower bounds the log-marginal likelihood:\n\u2212L ( \u2113 p) (xi) = log p(x) \u2212 H ( q(zi )) \u2265 log p (x \u2113 (xi , \u03c3 2 )) , (2)\nwhere H ( q(zi )) is the entropy of q(zi ). This observation suggests that we can use the ELBO estimate for both training and evidence estimation (Mackay, 1992), even though\nH ( q(zi )) cannot be computed explicitly. This is the idea at the heart of all existing variational objectives and has found many applications in machine learning, however, it is known to underestimate the evidence strongly (Jordan et al., 1999; Blei et al., 2016). The fact that the ELBO estimate is not tight prompted research into looser bounds of the form\nDKL ( q(zi)|p (zi ) ) \u2212 K L ( q(zi )|| p (zi ) ) (x) \u2265 log p (x \u2113 (xi , \u03c3 2 )) .

(2007) is the closest method we are aware of and we discuss it in detail as well as provide novel results in Appendix B, page 14. Another exciting recent work is perturbative variational inference (Bamler et al., 2017) which considers different objective functions for variational inference; we are not sure whether there exists a deeper relationship to debiasing schemes. There also exists a large body of work that uses the ELBO objective but considers ways to enlarge the variational family. This is useful because the larger the variational family, the smaller the bias. Non-linear but invertible transformations of reference densities have been used initially for density estimation in NICE (Dinh et al., 2014) and for variational inference in Hamiltonian variational inference (Salimans et al., 2015). Around the same time the general framework of normalizing flows (Rezende & Mohamed, 2015) unified the previous works as some invertible continuous transformation of a distribution. Since then a large number of specialized flows with different computational requirements and flexibility have been constructed: inverse autoregressive flows (Kingma et al., 2016), masked autoregressive flows Papamakarios et al. (2017), and Householder flows (Tomczak & Welling, 2016).

(2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al.

The paper provides a way of efficiently computing the bias of the IWAE objective.

I would like to know your thoughts on this observation.\nI also think that a more interesting problem for JVI would be to approximate the marginal likelihood by an arbitrary (unbiased) estimator T\u0302, e.g., generated by annealing the weights, through the JVI debiased formula rather than T\u0302 from the IWAE estimator.  I agree. However, as the author of the paper states: JVI is useful for evaluation and comparison of models but is not suitable for training. The JVI objective is essentially a non-bounded estimator, therefore when training the optimization routine is no longer constrained to remain in the true posterior. Interestingly, this leads to the best ELBO model achieving a lower JVI value than both the IWAE and JVI objectives. The implication of this is not obvious.

To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution.

Overall its hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds. Nevertheless the bounds achieved do not look much worse than the non-error counterparts and are easy to implement. The rest of the bounds focus on achieving low error in approximation of the gradients in various settings.

Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case.

Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

We propose and theoretically prove a method based on a nonlinear transformation to express the TT decomposition, incorporating an arbitrary associative binary operator as a nonlinearity.

(Vasilescu & Terzopoulos, 2002), in their framework of TensorFaces, proposed to treat facial image data as multidimensional arrays and analyze them with tensor decompositions, which led to significant boost in face recognition accuracy. (Bailey & Aeron, 2017) employed higher-order co-occurence data and tensor factorization techniques to improve on word embeddings models. Tensor methods also allow to produce more accurate and robust recommender systems by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments (Frolov & Oseledets, 2017). In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Expansion of the generalized tensor network beyond the case of multiplication nonlinearities to rectifier nonlinearities where \u03be(x, y) = max(x, y, 0), and the inclusion of shared cores. 2. Mathematical proof of the universality of generalized tensor networks on a subset of RNNs. 3. Demonstration of the effect of expressivity, where a RNN of rank R can be exponentially more compact than a fully connected network with the same parameters. However, they also report another subset of RNNs for which they cannot achieve full expressivity.\nFinally, I will highlight the limitations and potential areas for future research.\nFirst and foremost, the paper demonstrates that with rectifier nonlinearities, generalized tensor networks are universally applicable. It can represent any functions efficiently, but it also proves that it is possible to realize any generalized tensor networks as a very compact shallow network with \u03be-nonlinearities. Although they cannot realize all the functions on the same complexity with shallow networks for the case of rectifier nonlinearities, they state that this may not be a concern since the probability for it to happen is negligible with large R and T.\nOne limitation of this paper is its experimentally-driven proof of the expressivity theorem. It is more natural to employ a theoretical approach with mathematical tools to prove the expressivity of generalized tensor networks, which could provide an alternative insight and proof.\nFurthermore, the paper discusses the expressivity of generalized RNNs, but it only proves this for one particular \u03be-nonlinearity. It would be interesting and beneficial to explore the expressivity of generalized tensor networks for a greater variety of nonlinearities, as they provide a general mathematical framework that can accommodate multiple forms of nonlinearities.\nIn conclusion, the paper provides novel insights into the connection between generalized tensor networks and recurrent neural networks with arbitrary \u03be-nonlinearities", "evaluation": "rouge"}

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al.

Kakade Roni Stern\nAbstract: The majority of recent works in reinforcement learning are based on stochastic gradient methods. These methods are known to suffer from high variance, typically leading to undesirable fluctuations in the resulting policy. In this work, we use a specific type of regularization, termed control regularization, which is inspired by ideas from control theory. The regularization is added to the objective function being optimized and is designed to encourage smooth control actions. Our method is simple to implement and does not require specifying a regularizer, unlike existing approaches to variance reduction in stochastic gradient methods which rely on the use of additional hyperparameters. We show theoretically by a Lyapunov-type theorem that this regularizer ensures a smooth policy in an almost sure sense, in which case, we can apply strong convergence results for stochastic gradient methods to develop a sample complexity bound. Furthermore, we demonstrate that control regularization can be used as a general variance reduction technique for a variety of tasks, including model-free and model-based reinforcement learning for tabular MDPs and continuous action domains, with high-dimensional or continuous observations, as well as exploration optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that the method consistently leads to variance reduction for all of the aforementioned problems both in tabular and continuous action domains, outperforming other baselines such as entropy regularization, natural policy gradient and KL regularization-based approach.\nOur work introduces a new regularizer for stochastic gradient optimization algorithms that is agnostic to the underlying dynamics and does not require any hyperparameter tuning. This allows our method to perform well across a wide range of tasks, making it suitable for real-world applications.\nTitle: Addressing function approximation error in actor-critic methods\nAuthors: Scott Fujimoto Herke van Hoof Jan-Willem van de Graaf John Schulman\nAbstract: The majority of successful applications of deep RL have been based on simple actor-critic algorithms.

However, I have major concerns regarding the novelty this paper, the various claims it makes, as well as its experiment setting.\n\nMajor issues/questions:\n1. The techniques proposed by this paper lack novelty. For instance, the entire section 3.2 is simply the original design of the multi-head self-attention by Vaswani et al. The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below). Moreover, some prior works have already exploited the locality structure in Transformers. For instance, [1] showed that a sparse, local Transformer can work extremely well and be very efficient (they achieved SOTA on large-scale char-level language modeling tasks).\n\n2. The experiments do not entirely convince me. \n    i) The authors use the \"same hidden size for R-Transformer and Transformer.\" But in fact, as the R-Transformer has one extra RNN/LSTM/GRU layer at every level of the network, the tests were carried out (in effect) using a larger model than the baselines. I think the authors should instead control the # of model parameters, especially since you are running only on small tasks with small-sized models.\n    ii) It is nice that the authors tested R-Transformer on a variety of tasks--- this is important. However, in no way do these number achieve the levels of the \"state-of-the-art\", which the authors claim at the end of Section 1 (e.g., [2] has better number on seqMNIST and character-level PTB, and the Transformer-XL actually achieves <55 perplexity on word-level PTB). Therefore, the numbers don't look particularly appealing to me. \n    iii) Lack of more challenging, or large-scale experiments.\n    iv) Lack of ablative study. \n\n3. The authors claim that the finite-window RNN captures local features. But doesn't that claim only applies to the first layer? Once the first layer multi-head attention mixes all input elements across the sequence, the \"local\" features fed into the second layer RNN will be, actually, **global** features?

Secondly, the experimental settings follow those of the original TCN paper, potentially limiting the fairness of comparison between R-Transformer and the original implementation of TCN.

This paper uses uncertainty sampling to identify regions where the training data are not common, providing more focus on these regions. Furthermore, this paper has experimented with its proposed method in a variety of domains, including images, games, and robotics, and has shown superior performance compared to standard imitation learning methods. Contrast with the existing work. This paper presents a novel method for imitation learning that uses uncertainty sampling to identify regions where the training data are not common. This method is an extension of existing imitation learning methods that focus solely on minimizing policy losses. The Experiment. The experiments were conducted in various domains, including images, games, and robotics. These domains were chosen to assess the performance of the proposed method in a variety of tasks. A comparison was made with three standard imitation learning methods. The Results. The empirical results showed that our method outperformed existing imitation learning methods and achieved better task performance. The paper\u2019s findings have significant practical implications for imitation learning, particularly for tasks where data sparsity is an issue. The contribution. The proposed method, Disagreement-Regularized Imitation Learning (DRIL), is a novel approach for imitation learning that uses uncertainty sampling to identify regions where the training data are not common. This method offers a more robust and accurate imitation learning approach, particularly in environments with data sparsity. The use of uncertainty sampling also allows for focused learning on areas where the model is most uncertain, providing more efficient and effective imitation learning. DRIL is an efficient imitation learning method with practical applications, particularly in domains where data sparsity is an issue. This approach may also pave the way for future research in imitation learning and reinforcement learning, with the potential to improve upon current methods. We argue that the proposed method addresses the problem of covariate shift in imitation learning by using uncertainty-based rewards. We show that our approach is able to obtain good performance on a range of different environments. While our analysis is only linear in the time horizon, this could potentially be improved with more sophisticated optimistic estimates or improved regret bounds for RL.\nWe argue that our approach, which uses supervised learning to obtain an ensemble of models, is robust to a variety of domains. This has the additional benefit of not requiring expensive adversarial training and can often perform more quickly than generative adversarial approaches during training.

The problem of covariate shift was already observed, as the author notes: \u201cthe network must not solely be shown examples of accurate driving, but also how to recover once a mistake has been made\u201d. This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer. This rewards the agent for repeating (or returning to) the expert\u2019s transitions.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document. Please follow the instruction after this document.

More specifically, these ensemble policies are trained using BC loss. Under a limited amount of data (where BC fails), these policies would also fail and are inaccurate. Therefore, it should not be expected that a posterior from these inaccurate policies is accurate. Have the authors measure or analyze accuracy of these policies or that of the posterior? This important point is not mentioned or analyzed in the paper.\n\n- Alternative approaches to posterior approximation and uncertainty computation. \nThere are other approaches to obtain a posterior besides the ensemble approach, e.g., Bayesian neural networks. Such alternatives were not mentioned in the paper. Also, there are other quantities for measuring uncertainty besides the variance such as the entropy. These approaches and quantities have different pros and cons and they should be discussed in the paper.\n\n- Sample complexity in terms of environment interactions. \nThe sample complexity in terms of environment interactions is an important criterion for IL. I suggest the authors to include this criterion in the experiments. \n\n* Minor questions:\n- Why does the minibatch size is only 4 in the experiments for all methods.

Behavior cloning involves using supervised learning techniques to learn from expert demonstrations, while reinforcement learning can be used to fine-tune the learned policy in order to handle the covariate shift issue.\nDRIL introduces a new cost function that incorporates a term for the variance in the estimated policy. The goal of this cost function is to discourage the learned policy from deviating too much from the expert\u2019s behavior, thus minimizing the effect of covariate shift.\nIn the experiments conducted by the authors, DRIL was compared to standard behavioral cloning.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

The authors suggest that this prior can be applied to a wide variety of other distributions and may allow for more flexible priors, which may be more suitable for different types of data.

GuessWhat is one of the famous taskoriented dialog tasks, where the goal is to figure out a target object in the image through a dialog that the answerer has in mind (de Vries et al., 2017). However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%. In the object guessing task (i.e., GuessWhat task itself), the state-of-the-art averaged accuracy of SL, RL (Zhang et al., 2018b), and AQM (Lee et al., 2018) reached 44.6% and 60.8%, and 72.9% at the 5th round, respectively.

GuessWhich is a cooperative two-player game that one player tries to figure out an image out of 9,628 that another has in mind (Das et al., 2017b).

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The paper proposes an improvement over the AQM approach for an information-theoretic framework for task-oriented dialog systems. Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. \n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth. The terse nature of the content makes it hard to follow in general. If someone apriori was not familiar with task-oriented dialog or the visual dialog setting in Das et al. (2017b), it would be quite hard to follow.\n- While mentioning SL/RL approaches while comparing or introducing the setup, the authors do not make any distinction between discriminative and generative dialog models. Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd.

{"query": "Please generate the Abstract section for this paper.", "gt": "Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) models can be vulnerable in various scenarios, where noises from different sources could appear. For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when observed rewards are collected through sensors), and thus observed rewards may not be credible. Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines. For instance, the state-of-the-art PPO algorithm is able to obtain 67.5% and 46.7% improvements in average on five Atari games, when the error rates are 10% and 30% respectively.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Recent studies (Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) show that learned RL policies can be easily misled with small perturbations in observations. The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). However, these robust RL algorithms mainly focus on noisy vision observations, instead of the observed rewards. A couple of recent works (Lim et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2017) have also looked into a rather parallel question of training robust RL algorithms with uncertainty in models. Learning with Noisy Data Learning appropriately with biased data has received quite a bit of attention in recent machine learning studies Natarajan et al. (2013); Scott et al. (2013); Scott (2015); Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014); van Rooyen & Williamson (2015); Menon et al. (2015). The idea of above line of works is to define unbiased surrogate loss function to recover the true loss using the knowledge of the noises. We adapt these approaches to reinforcement learning. Though intuitively the idea should apply in our RL settings, our work is the first one to formally establish this extension both theoretically and empirically. Our quantitative understandings will provide practical insights when implementing reinforcement learning algorithms in noisy environments.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "the paper focuses on an interesting and relatively unexplored direction for RL. Apart from the work cited by the paper (and perhaps work like Krueger et al. (2016), in which agents must pay some cost to observe true rewards), there is little work on learning settings of this kind. This paper represents a first step in gaining clarity on how to formalize and study this problem. I did, however, find the analysis and the experiments to be relatively disjointed -- the main sample complexity result presented by the paper (Theorem 2) was given for Phased Q-Learning, yet no experiments actually evaluate the performance of Phased Q-Learning. I think the paper could benefit from experiments focused on simple domains that showcase how traditional algorithms do in cases where it is easier to understand (and visualize) the impact of the reward perturbations (simple chain MDPs, grid worlds, etc.) -- and specifically experiments including Phased Q-Learning. \n\nSection 1) Introduction:\n\t- \"adversaries in real-world\" --> \"adversaries in the real-world\"\n\t- You might consider citing Loftin et al. (2014) regarding the bulleted point about \"Application-Specific Noise\".\n\t- \"unbiased reward estimator aided reward robust reinforcement learning framework\" --> this was a bit hard to parse.

Why can't $\\gamma = 0$?\n\t- The transition notation changes between $\\mathbb{P}_a(s_{t+1} | s_t)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$. I'd suggest picking one and sticking with it to improve clarity.\n\t- \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" --> Why is the Q-function just an example? Isn't is *the* state-action value function? That is, I'd suggest replacing \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" with \"to learn a state-action value function, also called the Q-function\"\n\t- \"Q-function calculates\" --> \"The Q-function denotes\"\n\t- \"the reward feedbacks perfectly\" --> \"the reward feedback perfectly\"\n\t- I prefer that the exposition of the perturbed reward MDP be done with C in the tuple. So: $\\tilde{M} = \\langle \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{R}, C, \\mathcal{P}, \\gamma \\rangle$. This seems the most appropriate definition, since the observed rewards will be generated by $C$.\n\t- The setup of the confusion matrix for reward noise over is very clean. It might be worth pointing out that $C$ need not be Markovian. There are cases where C is not just a function of $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$, like the adversarial case you describe early on.\n\n\n4) Experiments:\n\t- Diverse experiments! That's great. Lots of algorithms, lots of environment types.\n\t- I expected to see Phrased Q-Learning in the experiments. Why was it not included?\n\t- The plots are pretty jagged, so I'm left feeling a bit skeptical about some of the results. The results would be strengthened if the experiments were repeated for more trials.\n\n6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Wang et al. (2018) proposed a Reinforced Ranker-Reader model that ranks retrieved evidence and assigns different weights to evidence prior to processing by the reader. Min et al. (2018) demonstrated that for several popular MRC datasets (e.g. SQuAD, TriviaQA) most questions can be answered using only a few sentences rather than the entire document. Motivated by this observation, they built a sentence selector to gather this potential evidence for use by the reader model. Nishida et al. (2018) developed a multi-task learning (MTL) method for a retriever and reader in order to obtain a strong retriever that considers certain passages including the answer text as positive samples during training. The proposed MTL framework is still limited to the scenario when it is feasible to discover whether the passages contain the answer span. Although these works have achieved progress on open-domain QA by improving the ranking or selection of given evidence, few have focused on the scenario where the model needs to start by searching for the evidence itself. Scientific Question Answering (SQA) is a representative open-domain task that requires capability in both retrieval and reading comprehension. In this paper, we study question answering on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) scientific QA dataset (Clark et al., 2018).

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "This paper has made two major contributions: (1) a new neural reader architecture for multi-choice QA; (2) it is the first to introduce essential term selection to open-domain QA, to the best of my knowledge. The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me. Experiments on the ARC dataset shows that (1) the proposed reader itself improves over the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard; (2) introducing the essential term selector further improves the above results by about 2%.\n\nAlthough the paper also provides additional experiments on other datasets, I feel that the contributions of the proposed methods are not sufficiently verified. I would suggest the authors consider the following further experiments that I believe could improve its ratings:\n\n(1) The proposed reader works very well on ARC. However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions. Again, the authors reported results on two other datasets. However, on neither of these datasets the ET-RR was compared with ET-RR (Concat). Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision. For example, using REINFORCE to learn the selector model with the rewards from the end-task performance.

The ET-RR model consists of an essential term selector, ET-Net, to discover which terms are essential in a question and a reader to process retrieved evidence. The ET-Net model selects essential terms in a question by learning to predict a binary variable indicating whether a word is essential or not based on the context of the question. The reader model processes retrieved evidence by adding attention and fusion mechanisms among passages, questions, and candidate answers. In experiments, the proposed model outperforms existing QA models on the ARC, RACE-Open, and MCScipt-Open datasets. The model is more effective than existing retrieval-reader-based methods when dealing with tasks that require retrieving relevant evidence from a large volume of open-domain resources. However, the model has some limitations. For example, the performance of ET-RR when retrieving evidence is highly dependent on the quality of the retrieval process, and the use of TF-IDF to select essential terms is not effective in open-domain QA datasets. Despite these limitations, the ET-RR model makes significant contributions to the open-domain QA field and provides a new direction for further research.

Moreover, optimization in DNNs is no longer about finding any minimum, but rather about finding ones that generalizes well (Keskar et al., 2016). Since deep networks are initialized randomly, finding such minima will require exploration of different regions of the loss surface. This intuition has been formalized in recent papers that study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as a diffusion process (Hoffer et al., 2017; Smith & Le, 2017; Jastrzebski et al., 2017; Chaudhari & Soatto, 2017). Briefly, these papers show that SGD simulates a discrete approximation of stochastic differential equation (SDE), and hence performs a random walk on the potential induced by the DNN loss surface.\nIn this work, we complement the diffusion perspective of SGD with a qualitative view of how SGD explores different regions of the non-convex loss landscape of deep neural networks through empirical evidence. Intuitively, when performing random walk on a potential, one would expect barriers being crossed quite often during the process. We show in this work that SGD rarely crosses any barriers along its path during the course of training. By this observation, we do not claim that SGD does not simulate diffusion. Through experimental deductions, we show an alternate mechanism that SGD seems to dominantly use to explore different regions of the non-convex loss landscape.\nFurther, it is known that larger batch-sizes slow down the diffusion process (Hoffer et al., 2017). We show the qualitative reason behind this slow down to be an oscillation behavior of SGD which prevents it from moving far away from initialization. This behavior is a result of the mini-batch gradients becoming increasingly aligned with the top eigenvectors of the Hessian for larger batch-sizes. This behavior is known to slow down convergence in optimization theory (for instance consider the motivation behind momentum (Polyak, 1964; Sutskever et al., 2013)). We discuss how it also slows down explorations in the non-convex setting", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Perhaps Goodfellow et al. (2014) is most similar to our work since we use the loss interpolation tool suggested in their paper to perform our analysis. They perform interpolation between the initial and final parameters and based on their finding, draw the conclusion that the loss along the line connecting these two points does not have any barriers.

The authors conducted experiments using the diffusion perspective of SGD as a tool to qualitatively visualize the exploration mechanism employed by different optimization algorithms, including SGD, to train neural networks.\nSecond, the authors proposed a new framework for the analysis of SGD training in the non-convex setting of deep network loss surface. Specifically, by interpolating the DNN loss surface between parameters before and after each SGD update, they were able to quantitatively measure how frequently SGD crosses barriers along its path during training. To their surprise, they found that SGD rarely crosses any barriers during training, a finding that contradicts expectations based on the diffusion perspective of SGD. They then explored an alternate hypothesis based on this finding, suggesting that SGD exploration in non-convex optimization settings involves moving over rather than crossing barriers.\nThird, the authors explored the role of batch size in SGD's exploration strategy, arguing that the alignment of mini-batch gradients with the sharp directions of the loss surface increases as batch size increases. They hypothesized that this alignment slows down exploration by causing SGD to oscillate in the vicinity of the initialized parameters, leading to fewer parameter updates being performed. This finding helps explain the negative effect of large batch sizes on SGD convergence, as previously observed by Hoffer et al. (2017).\nFourth, the authors made comparisons of their findings with previous research on optimization in quadratic settings. They noted that the oscillation behavior they observed during SGD training has similarities to the underdamped oscillations that occur in solving quadratic functions with non-isotropic Hessians.\nFifth, the authors acknowledged that the conclusions they drew are based on experiments conducted only on a limited set of datasets, architectures, and hyper-parameter settings, and that the results may vary depending on these parameters. Nonetheless, they provided additional empirical examples of the quadratic-like structures found in SGD trajectories, demonstrating that the observations presented in the main text are not unique to a single experiment or architecture.\nSixth, the authors highlighted the potential practical implications of their analysis.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The subject of how a given algorithm explores the landscape is still a poorly understood area in training neural networks. There is a large body of recent work that attempts to shed light on this puzzle, and each one tries to claim their share in the furthering of the understanding of the relationship between the geometry of the landscape and the dynamics that one chooses in optimization. The present paper is a fine addition to the literature with interesting observations and novel questions, however, it falls short in many core areas: An apparent work in progress that has a great potential. \n\nA major question (that I hope will easily be addressed) is on the definition of the barrier itself. According to the text, a barrier is defined judging by the minima of two 1-dimensional segments that connect weights connecting three consecutive steps: if the minimum of the line segment defined by the latter step is larger than the former, then it declared that a barrier is crossed. In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The use of larger batch sizes for gradient descent updates on deep neural networks can reduce the overall convergence rate, compared to when smaller batch sizes are used. The underlying reason for this observation is that, when a larger mini-batch is used, the updates become closer to applying the true stochastic gradient, rather than an average stochastic gradient over a minibatch. As a result, the algorithm moves back and forth within a small region around the local optima, where it gets stuck for longer periods. This behavior of stochastic gradient descent optimization on non-convex loss landscapes can be understood through the diffusion process model. This model has been shown to effectively simulate stochastic gradient descent with large batch sizes (Hoffer et al., 2017). While the diffusion model can provide a rigorous understanding of SGD optimization, in this paper we present visual evidence that demonstrates the behavior of SGD during optimization. Our findings show that the quadratic-like shape of the loss interpolation between parameters from consecutive updates is present in almost all SGD training runs on deep networks; while the actual loss values may vary significantly. Additionally, the minimum along this loss curve fluctuates but the values are typically in the same vicinity as the last two loss values.\n2. One hypothesis that can explain this quadratic-like shape of the loss interpolation in non-convex settings is the assumption that in deep networks, the eigenvectors of the Hessian have low norm. It would result in smaller gradient lengths with larger batch sizes due to the decreased gradient variance. The authors also propose that SGD can exhibit oscillations along with the sharp directions of the loss function, thus slowing down the exploration process.\n3. Despite the differences between the optimization landscape of convex loss functions and those of non-convex loss functions, the quadratic-like shape of loss interpolation between consecutive training updates remains a dominant behavior in DNN training. The analysis conducted on various datasets, architectures, and hyper-parameter settings suggests that this behavior holds in a broad range of settings. However, additional experiments could be carried out to study the relationship between deep network architecture and the optimization landscape in more detail. The theoretical explanations for the quadratic shape of the loss interpolation in non-convex settings can serve as a starting point for further research. \n\nI have some questions from your answer:\n1.
