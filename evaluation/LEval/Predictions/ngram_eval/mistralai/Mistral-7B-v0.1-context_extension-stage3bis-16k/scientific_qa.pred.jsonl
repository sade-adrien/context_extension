[/INST] Can I have a bit more information about the biases in data collection and annotations, and how they are manifest in these datasets? \nSure, here are more details on data collection and annotation biases in the hate speech datasets utilized in this study:\nData Collection Bias:\n1. Database-based approach: The datasets of Waseem and Hovy BIBREF5 and Waseem BIBREF23 were created using a database-based approach in which tweets containing particular terms from a dictionary (pre-defined lexicon) are accumulated using Twitter API. Although this approach covers more hate speech content, the dataset contains some biases due to pre-selection of terms. For example, Waseem et al. BIBREF10 showed that race-related hate speech is over-represented in their dataset.\n2. Ad-hoc approach: Other datasets such as HateBased-dataset BIBREF9 are annotated using an ad-hoc approach that searches for common slurs or terms related to religious, sexual, gender, or ethnic minorities. In this collection method, there are other biases because people do not use common slurs in their everyday communications and this approach may result in nonrepresentative dataset.\nAnnotation Bias:\n1. Expert Annotation: In many datasets, annotations are made either by experts or crowdsourcing users based on their personal opinions and knowledge. Due to bias of human annotations, the dataset is created based on annotator's preferences and biases instead of the actual hate speech context. Furthermore, the level of annotation will change from annotators to annotators, so a new annotator may label a sample differently.\n2. Label imbalance: Another bias in the datasets can be attributed to data imbalance that most people are more likely to report or annotate hate speech against minorities than against themselves. In such imbalanced datasets, our model can be more confused between certain classes. Considering the results (see Figure FIGREF19 and FIGREF19), our BERT based classifier is generally confused with the context between the words which leads to", "evaluation": "f1"}

Specifically, syntactic features are used to identify potential argument candidates, and then roles are assigned based on the syntactic features and function assignments of these candidates. This baseline model is simple and has been widely used in the SRL literature. \nIn terms of related work, the baseline SRL model used in this paper is similar to other unsupervised SRL models such as the one proposed by garg2012unsupervised described in section SECREF29. For crosslingual unsupervised SRL, the baseline model used by titov2012bayesian from section SECREF30 is also similar in that it uses a syntactic function assignment as a role label candidate. However, the baseline model used in this paper does not involve any additional feature engineering and heuristics beyond the syntactic features used for argument identification.\nAdditionally, as discussed in section SECREF31 and SECREF30, the baseline model used by titov2012bayesian from section SECREF30 has different argument identification strategies resulting in higher CO than the model used in the this paper. Therefore, the comparison of the baseline model used in the paper with that used by titov2012bayesian from section SECREF30 is not directly valid. \nIn summary, the baseline SRL model used in this paper is a simple baseline method used widely in the SRL literature. It identifies arguments based on syntactic functions and assigns roles based on a simple majority voting strategy, which makes it easy to compare with other SRL models in an unsupervised setup.

Word embedding generates a vector representation for each word in a corpus by analyzing the context in which it appears. The vectors are often created in a 200-dimensional space, where each dimension is a real number that corresponds to a dimension of the vector space. However, word embedding may not fully capture the sentimental aspects of words. In this work, we propose to create original and more effective word vectors that take into account the sentimental aspects of words, as described in Section 3.1-3.4\nInstead of directly using the corpus, we first construct a matrix whose entries correspond to the number of cooccurrences of the row and column words in sliding windows. Then, we normalize each row and generate a cosine similarity matrix. Finally, we perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the matrix's dimensionality. The results are presented in Section 4, and our proposed approach outperforms the conventional approaches in both Turkish and English corpora [].\nMoreover, to capture the sentimental aspect of words, we utilize the Turkish word dictionary (TDK) that includes word polarities. We follow the boolean approach and assign a score of 1 to the row-wise dictionary definition word entries, and a score of 0 otherwise. Then, we perform clustering on the matrix constructed using the dictionary definitions. Since supervised scores are not taken into account in this approach, we combine unsupervised and supervised scores to generate a unified score for each word in Section 3.3.\nOur proposed approach performs well in all corpora, and the corpus-based-PCA approach outperforms the word2vec approach. In addition, we introduce a simple metric called ``Supervised contextual 4-scores\" that utilize four supervised scores for each word in the corpus. The results from this approach are promising, especially considering that it is a simple metric that does not rely on a deep learning model. Our work contributes to building more effective word vectors that take into account sentimental information, and we hope our findings can be useful in other research fields.\nCitation ::: References\n1.

SVM with average word embedding: This model uses the average of word embeddings as a representation of the document to be classified. The word embeddings are trained on the same dataset as the documents to be classified.\n3.

It can be calculated as an average of the logarithm of the expected probability over all sequences of tokens. 2) BLEU-1/4 and ROUGE-L: These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of generated text. BLEU measures how well a sequence of tokens matches the expected sequence of tokens in a reference, and ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence of references and generated sequences. 3) Distinct-1/2: This metric measures the diversity of generated text. It calculates the proportion of distinct unigrams and bigrams in the generated text. 4) MRR: Mean reciprocal rank is a metric used to evaluate how well a system performs in retrieval tasks. In the context of recipe generation, it measures the average inverse rank at which the correct user profile was retrieved. 5) Recipe-level coherence: This metric assesses the overall coherence of a recipe by evaluating the correctness of the sequence of recipe steps. 6) Step entailment: This metric calculates local coherence by measuring the likelihood that a new step logically follows the preceding step. 7) Human evaluation: In small-scale surveys, human evaluators compare the quality and coherence of generated recipes by pairwise comparison. 8) Coherent: Our personalized models achieve average recipe-level coherence scores of 1.78-1.82, indicating they outperform baseline at 1.77. 9) Preferable: Our personalized models achieve mean recipe-level entailment scores of 0.71-0.76, indicating they outperform the baseline at 0.68. 10) Personalized recipes preferred by humans 63% of the time, as verified by pairwise comparison surveys. 11) 70% of users found recipes generated by personalized models more coherent, as verified through small-scale human coherence survey.\nI hope this answered your question; please feel free to reach out if you need any further assistance.

Here is your summary: The authors introduce a task of generating personalized recipes from incomplete input specifications using user profiles to learn historical preferences from previous recipe reviews. The work combines two important tasks in NLP and recommender systems: data-to-text generation and personalized recommendation. The dataset for this task consists of 180K recipes and 700K user reviews from the Food.com website with 18 years of interaction data (2000-2018). The authors present three personalized models that outperform a baseline recipe generation system in BPE perplexity, Distinct-1/2 and UMA metrics. The models, referred to as Prior Tech, Prior Name and Prior Recipe, were compared with the encoder-decoder baseline model for recipe generation. Qualitative analysis shows a progressive improvement in outputs from the baseline to a blended cocktail produced by the best performing personalized model. Additionally, the personalized models beat the baseline in BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, UMA and MRR metrics, indicating better recipe alignment with user profiles. The Prior Name model achieved the best UMA and MRR scores with better BLEU-1 performance, revealing that prior recipe names are strong signals for personalization. The local and recipe-level coherence measures, calculated based on step entailment and coherence scoring, respectively, show better scores for personalized models.

The method involves leveraging discourse relations between events to propagate the sentiments of those events. The authors claim that not much human effort is required in providing supervision, apart from a very small seed lexicon.\nExperiments were carried out on a large Japanese corpus, and the pre-trained BiGRU encoder was found to be more effective than BERT in learning sentiment polarities. The authors also claim that when small labeled data are available, using our method along with labeled data provided better results than using labeled data alone, showing its effectiveness in such a scenario. The authors presented examples demonstrating that their model learned sentimental/emotional polarities without explicit supervision and was able to capture non-compositional expressions as well.

For example, if an event $x_1$ is described as causing an event $x_2$ and the seed lexicon suggests $x_2$ is positive, $x_1$ is likely to be positive because it triggers the positive emotion. Similarly, if $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in the discourse relation of Concession, the reverse of $x_2$'s polarity can be propagated to $x_1$. We transform these ideas into objective functions and train neural network models that predict the polarity of a given event.

Initially, sequential results of named entity recognition on both paragraph and query texts are integrated together. Contextualized representation on both paragraph and query texts is then transformed by a pre-trained language model. To achieve the best performance for a specific dataset, we pre-train the model in multiple datasets and then fine tune it on the specific dataset. \n\nParkinson disease is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with a large unmet medical need for better biomarkers. Here, we performed a translational genomics study to identify gene signatures and pathway signatures associated with the neurodegenerative process in parkinson disease. We first compared postmortem striatal tissue gene expression in patients with parkinson disease to expression in age-matched controls. Using gene set enrichment analysis and a Bayesian framework to quantify the biological relevance of these signatures, we identified sets of genes differentially expressed in the postmortem striatum of patients with parkinson disease associated with", "evaluation": "f1"}

Please summarize this document. Document is as follows. Introduction Social Media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit have empowered individuals' voices and facilitated freedom of expression. However they have also been a breeding ground for hate speech and other types of online harassment. Hate speech is defined in legal literature as speech (or any form of expression) that expresses (or seeks to promote, or has the capacity to increase) hatred against a person or a group of people because of a characteristic they share, or a group to which they belong BIBREF0. Twitter develops this definition in its hateful conduct policy as violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. In this work we focus on hate speech detection. Due to the inherent complexity of this task, it is important to distinguish hate speech from other types of online harassment. In particular, although it might be offensive to many people, the sole presence of insulting terms does not itself signify or convey hate speech. And, the other way around, hate speech may denigrate or threaten an individual or a group of people without the use of any profanities. People from the african-american community, for example, often use the term nigga online, in everyday language, without malicious intentions to refer to folks within their community, and the word cunt is often used in non hate speech publications and without any sexist purpose. The goal of this work is not to discuss if racial slur, such as nigga, should be pursued. The goal is to distinguish between publications using offensive terms and publications attacking communities, which we call hate speech. Models Contribution We propose the novel task of hate speech detection in multimodal publications, collect, annotate and publish a large scale dataset. We evaluate state of the art multimodal models on this specific task and compare their performance with unimodal detection. Even though images are proved to be useful for hate speech detection, the proposed multimodal models do not outperform unimodal textual models. We study the challenges of the proposed task, and open the field for future research.
