However, there are insurance policies that cater specifically to car owners who do not own a car, but still need to ensure their use of a vehicle. These policies are different from standard car insurance policies, with coverages that are more tailored to cover the individual's needs.\n\n\nNote: The answers provided by this AI chatbot are based on the information it has gathered through the training process. Therefore, the answers may not be 100% accurate or complete. Additional research or further consultation with an insurance agent may be necessary for more detailed and accurate information about car insurance policies that are best suited for specific circumstances.\n\n\n\nDriving \nCar insurance is not required by law if you do not own a car, and therefore do not drive regularly. However, it is recommended that you get coverage if you are likely to drive frequently or take public transportation while driving. This will protect you in case of vehicle damage caused by collisions or theft.\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing insurance if you plan to drive others' cars frequently, you will likely need additional coverage, such as liability insurance , which covers the damage you cause to other people's property or injuries in case of an accident. Additionally, any coverage you need for your own car should also be adequate.\n\nIt is a good idea to explore all available options before making a final decision on insurance coverage, and to contact an experienced agent to receive accurate advice on the type of coverage that best meets your needs.\n\n\n\nInstruction: What is the purpose of car insurance? \nAnswer this question with 13 words.[/INST] Car insurance is important as it provides financial protection in the event of an accident.
