After a short conversation, Siddhartha entered the hut and the conversation with Kamavac began. Kamavac was initially hesitant to reveal his secrets, but Siddhartha succeeded in making him divulge his deepest secret. He wanted to teach Siddhartha, that is why he invited him. He asked Siddhartha about his parents, his family, his former teachers and his quest for wisdom. Siddhartha was not interested in learning about Samanas and Atharvans and he was not looking for teachers who would teach him about Atman and Brahman. He wanted to learn about himself and about how to realize his own self. The Brahmin realized that Siddhartha wanted to learn something different and they engaged in a long conversation.\nThe Brahmin taught Siddhartha how to swim and how to sit in the cool waters for hours. The young man became a master of the rafts and boats and became skilled in river navigation. During the time that Siddhartha stayed at the hut, he learned about the river. He became skilled at listening to the river and learnt about its different moods, the rise and fall of waters and different weather patterns. He learnt to love the river and its ways. This was more than the wisdom of the Samanas, the Atharvans and the ancient philosophers of Brahmanism.

However, Soames has said that if he were to go through the same steps in 1997, he would only have an\nhour to visit the reading room, and if he was lucky, he might have only 10\nminutes, based on the statement that the reading room was now empty, or as I\nhave quoted it: \"Nay, they'll no' be emptied--them book-cases hold many an\naged scholar; many a scribbling poet--and there's room for you, Soames; and\nfor me,\" said the red-eyed man again, slowly, \"for me!\" This shows us\nthat the clock was well past five when he began his journey.\n[/ANS]\nAccording to T.K. Nupton's book, the reading-rooms seem to have been\nchanged to a \"huge, clean, odorless sanctum\" where everybody is wearing\n\"some sort of uniform.\" What could he be saying when he says that \"I\nwent back to the middle desk and asked what was the best modern book on\nlate nineteenth-century", "evaluation": "f1"}

I'd rather say I'm not qualified to answer such questions about the coach's motives and actions because it is based on personal opinions and assumptions that are open to subjective interpretations. \nHowever, what I can generally say is that coaching is a difficult and demanding profession that requires a lot of dedication and hard work. It also involves making decisions that can affect the success and performance of the athletes or the team. As such, coaches are often scrutinized and criticized, with their actions and beliefs subjected to public debate and scrutiny. \nIn case of Brian Clough, he is well-known for his strong opinions and outspokenness, and he was not afraid to express his views even if they were unpopular or in contrast with public opinions. If one looks at what he said about Don Revie, it can be interpreted as a criticism of his coaching style and the way he ran the team, which in turn may suggest that Clough felt that Revie had other reasons for becoming a coach beyond the notion that he was too small to play.\nHowever, ultimately", "evaluation": "f1"}
