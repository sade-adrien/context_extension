Review #74: \"Hotel is very close the the airport and room was comfortable. Had a huge mirror in the bathroom that was well light around the edges. Wolfgang Puck coffee was available for the in-room coffee maker, My room was in the tower on the 8th floor and had a balcony. Parking was expensive but if you don't mind walking across the street there is a parking garage (Wally Park) that if you park on the roof is $12.95 plus tax. If you have a AAA membership they will give you 25% off. That's where I parked. Review #79: \"We stayed 3 days at the Doubletree Hotel in July 2006. The front desk staff were grouchy, uninterested and not pleasant to deal with. We experienced this poor attitude with a few other staff members within the hotel. We were quite surprised as this was the only hotel during our two week Washington State vacation that did not provide a fantastic experience. Too bad considering the hotel facilities are lovely and the rooms are comfortable. I would not stay at a Doubletree Hotel again. It is just not worth the money. Review #86: I am happy to write a positive review for the Doubletree Seattle Airport. This hotel is very convenient to the airport and was perfect for use as an overnight stay on an early flight out of town. Hotel is clean, room was very quiet, very comfortable bed, shower was great, and the staff I encountered was very nice. Free internet access is available in the lobby which is also open 24 hrs- this hotel goes out of their way to provide what guests want. The airport shuttle was there when we arrived back at the hotel late at night so a taxi back to airport is not needed. I would definitely stay at this hotel", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Nonetheless, overall, guests were satisfied with the cleanliness and hospitality offered by the hotel. Review #86:We spent one night at the Doubletree in July 2005. Our room was small, but clean and nicely decorated. The front desk folks were nice enough, but not very accommodating, and they seemed to frown when I left some bottles for a friend. The hotel is spread out and you have to walk a fair distance to the elevator to get to your room. The elevator to the lobby goes up to three floors, then turns right (I'm guessing towards the pool). They're not going to tell you anything unless you ask, so it's a good idea to ask about what you want when you check-in. We ate breakfast at the Doubletree restaurant which was adequate but the price is pretty steep--$7.95 for breakfast, which includes oatmeal, cereal and juice as well as toast and eggs. The hotel is a good deal for a single night if you are willing to walk around a bit. It is also very close to the airport and would be a good choice for an early morning flight. Review #87:We are staying at this hotel while we wait for the replacement to our broken down car. It is on the way down and should be here Friday. The hotel is really clean and a very nice hotel and staff. So much nicer than the others we have stayed in. We will be disappointed when we have to leave. 5 star rating Review #88:Our stay at this hotel was quite good. We were pleasently surprised when we got cookies when we checked in. The hotel seems to be in good shape for a chain hotel. My son, his girlfriend and friend stayed in the room and they all seemed to be fine with the room, but it was small. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The parking is expensive, but I have a feeling the parking is only that high for the short term guests who stay", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The staff were really friendly and helpful, we would highly recommend this hotel and will consider staying again when in Venice on our next visit. Review #84:I have stayed in Venice on a few occasions over the years. Last year I decided to book two nights at Hotel Al Duca di Venezia online. It is a very modern and well designed hotel. As our flight arrived at lunch time, we decided to forgo the boat ride and take a taxi to our hotel to save time. The Hotel was exactly where it said it was located. The room size, design and decor is much better than any other room I have stayed in in Venice. The Hotel is very quiet and was a perfect location and only a short distance walk from the train station. I would stay at this Hotel again. Review #85:We loved the location of the hotel! It was close to the trains, but also very close to the center of town. We had a room on the canal with a view of the Grand Canal. The room is very nice and a good size for Europe. The desk clerk was the nicest we encountered in Venice. Breakfast was okay, but not a great deal of variety. The bed was comfortable. We had a fantastic honeymoon and I would definitely recommend this hotel! Review #86:The Al Duca Hotel is located in Venice, walking distance to the Grand Canal and the Santa Lucia train station. We have stayed at in on our last two visits to Venice.The rooms are clean, brightly painted, tastefully decorated, and have comfortable mattresses. Staff is warm and helpful.

There were other reviews expressing dissatisfaction with service, price and noise. We were in a suite in July 2011 for an event at BC place and absolutely loved the hotel. We were very impressed.

The hotel has been remodeled and seems more modern than some older Marriott properties. The staff were very welcoming, friendly, and helpful from the concierge to the front desk, even if they did not know I worked for Marriott. The room size was good, and the beds were comfortable. However, I found the furniture to be of low quality, with knicks and scratches already marring surfaces. The new carpeting was already quite grungy, and the decor seemed more like a rental apartment than a proper hotel room. While the location and customer service were excellent, the room felt quite dated. Nonetheless, I would return to the hotel, although it definitely would not be good value at the rack rate.

Within easy walking distance were good restaurants, shops and places to relax. Across the road from the hotel was a good selection of groceries and shops, but with the Canadian dollar at nearly parity with the dollar, it paid to check prices at Safeway (just down Denman St.) where we found that quite a few things were cheaper. English Bay is just a couple of blocks down Denman and there we had a great time; swimming in warm sea water, relaxing, people watching on the beach or sitting on the shore. We also visited the famous 'Granville Island', got an Uber car to and from (about A15 return), had ice cream, and I went into the market for fresh food. We were lucky with the weather, and for three of the days managed to sit at the beach, reading with an occasional walk to the rock jetty and the water for a refresher. There were not many tourists and I think it was not a 'peak' time. Review #73:In July, my wife and I were seeking a week-long (Sunday-Saturday) stay in Vancouver. We've always used TripAdvisor for bookings - but on this visit we wanted to try a Canadian-only site as their exchange rate was more realistic. My search for Vancouver hotels brought us to a site called 'Trivago' - an aggregator much to TA's taste. It wasn't long before the Sandman Suites on Davie was in front of us. The price was right and the location near everything we wanted to do looked good. The 'extras' at SSVD included a fitness center, pool (at least it looked that way), in-suite laundry. We had a choice of standard double room or one with a kitchenette - the later being more expensive and in short supply. We were getting our 3rd room in 6 years - so the price and amenities tipped our scale. We had not had any problem with these rooms in the past so why not now? The 'front' of the hotel - facing Davie St. is clean, orderly and well kept - and all the rooms for the suites are on that side. The back of the hotel is very different. Rooms that open to the back of the hotel have a different decor and are furnished much differently. There", "evaluation": "rouge"}

Review #73:Wife and I stayed 8 nights at the Sandman Suite. Location is just fine. Davie street does have some adult shops but it is not any where near as bad as the gay village on Folsom street in San Francisco. There will be lots of interesting folks strolling around but nothing out of the ordinary. The suite itself was very clean and had everything one would need. The front desk is a little slow getting you checked in but not horrible. The staff at the attached restaurant are really nice and food was great. We would stay there again and would highly recommend it to someone visiting Vancouver. The room was in the 200 -300 range per day. Review #74:Way better than other Sandmans. We spent four nights in Vancouver at this location, for a conference. I would choose this location over all the other Sandman locations, including at Coal Harbour. The room's not fancy - a bit outdated, but that is part of the charm. Kitchenette had a regular fridge, a two burner range with a hood, full size oven, dishwasher and microwave. We cooked most meals, having been on the road for a while. Room was very spacious, had a living area and a well-appointed kitchen area, that made us feel at home. A king size bed was in the separate sleeping area, it seemed larger than the king size beds at the other sandman suites.

So be aware of that! And we also found that they do not have free newspaper, at at least the regular daily papers like the Globe and Mail. You will have to pay for that one, unlike the Delta Cambridge Suites which had everything free of charge. So the overall price we paid for one night was still good, but be aware of the service hours of the restaurant, and if you do not like to pay for the newspapers, this might not be the best choice for you as there are other hotels that do not charge for that.

Although our room was the least expensive available, on the 3rd floor courtyard side, it was clean, and had a great view from our tiny balcony of the roof tops across the street. For Europe, our room was a great fit, the beds very comfortable, bathroom adequate, though the shower was a bit tight.

On the outside, it almost blends in and you miss it as you pass by but then you enter to one of the most gorgeous lobbies we've ever encountered. Check in was very fast even though the hotel was full. We had a 4th floor view room and while the view was nice, and our bed was very comfortable, the rest of the room was dated compared to more recent Sofitel hotels like the one in Toulouse, or the one in Bordeaux. The room was very warm and uncomfortable - while there were 2 sets of drapes, they could not make the room any cooler. Sofitel should fix that. The hotel is conveniently located near Dam Square and the Red Light District. Breakfast was good and while not very impressive, we saw it being better in other Sofitel hotels such as the ones in Bordeaux and Toulouse. The hotel pool was tiny and located in the old basement part of the hotel. However, for a night swim, the room was warm. Dining however, was very good and we had an opportunity to have lunch in the Lobby. The service was excellent and the restaurant is very upscale. I do not think breakfast was much different (we missed lunch because we were in town for only 1 night and most of the day was spent seeing the sights). The hotel did not disappoint for what it was. Review #78:Stayed at this Sofitel for a long weekend - we were very impressed! It is a small luxury hotel, it didn't feel like a chain at all. The rooms are nice-sized with small kitchenettes, the bathrooms are beautiful", "evaluation": "rouge"}

The hotel is ideally located a short walk from the main canal and about 100 yards from the Red Light District which can be a source of noise and the street was quite busy at day and night. The room was fairly cramped, the bathroom was nice with very thick bath mats that did not slip and the showers were powerful and had excellent hot water but they drained into the bath and not down a plug hole so water would remain in the bath until all drained. The room furniture was old and worn, the TV was quite small and dated but the room was otherwise comfortable. The minibar and complimentary in room water was very expensive though and one canteen of coffee was only about two thirds full. Breakfast was quite tasty and there was plenty of it, but there was no way to heat the eggs and that was odd since everything else had heated plates. Room service was available but the menus were not in the room and you had to get to the ground floor to order from a limited menu and there were no prices, so service was not fast as dishes had to be priced.

Then later for something we ask for they gave us a key card to go to the business center with a computer and to use it for free and when we go there, there is a warning that this computer is for sale only. After checking in I ask for the breakfast included in the executive room, they said that they cannot give it and that I have to make a complaint for a free breakfast. I am not happy from this situation and we leave our room for breakfast and ask for complimentary breakfast as was expected and we are told that they don't have it and we have to pay \u20ac30.00 for breakfast and we are told if we don't pay for the food they put in front of us. Then, the room is very small and the amenities are old. So, it's only a good choice if you are a Marriott Platinum member.

The hotel is centrally located but at the end of a subway line which is great for commuting.

The taxi driver actually wanted to be kind to us and took a way that avoided tolls so he didn't charge us for them. We arrived at the Grand Flora and went to the front desk and immediately were treated very well by the person on duty. We were upgraded free of charge to a larger room, I think it was a junior suite which also had a pull out couch. It was very nice! The bed was even more comfortable than our bed at home. The hotel was near Villa Borghese. There were several cafes, shops, and a little grocery store around the hotel making it easy to venture out at night for some wine and pizza.

The grounds surrounding the hotel are very tranquil and in bloom with roses and beautiful trees. The front desk staff are very helpful making sure we got where we needed to go for our city tour or to the train station to transfer to Sorrento for the rest of our vacation. The restaurant, \"Baby\" has a great atmosphere and is beautiful with amazing food and service. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You really do get what you pay for.

The breakfast was very good and our lunch at the pool bar, although more expensive than most, was lovely. The service was good throughout and the only thing we would have like a bit more assistance with was the booking for our dinner at the Spanish steps and help to get home at night. The shuttle service was good but late, especially to get back from the Spanish steps and they do seem to have a lot of difficulty in finding cabs at the time you want, which was disappointing.

We had a room with garden view, which was wonderful, and it was very quiet. It's nice to be away from the crowds, although we did use the shuttle bus to go into town at least a couple of times. Review #76:I have stayed at the Hotel Aldrovandi several times in the past for business and it is very reliable and consistent. The rooms are comfortable and the hotel located within walking distance of the Spanish Steps (about 5 minutes - the hotel provides a shuttle bus but we prefer to walk - although there are also plenty of taxis). Staff is very helpful and polite. We always use the restaurant at the Aldrovandi, which is quite good and has a fairly extensive wine list. The hotel also provides complimentary shuttle bus travel service to downtown - a real bonus! The hotel and grounds and very nice and it is located across from the Borghese Gardens, which are worth a visit. You can just as easily take a taxi, there is an area behind Trevi which is used by taxis as a pick up area, so it is not necessary to walk through the Piazza if you are looking for a taxi. They always respond quickly (sometimes within minutes when we ask for a car) and you can always tell the driver where you are going and what time and date you want to be picked up.

I would recommend the aldrovandi villa borghese to anyone traveling to Rome. It is the perfect escape from all the noise and traffic of the city. Review #75:Just returned from the Aldrovandi Villa Borghese, a five-star hotel, near the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome. The hotel is located right across from the gardens and has a free shuttle to take you to and from the center of Rome, every thirty minutes. The hotel is very beautiful, the rooms are large and well-decorated and service was great. The location is good for those who want to be away from the tourist attractions but still close enough to get there quickly. I also recommend visiting the Villa Borghese gardens and the Galleria Borghese, which is next to the hotel. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would definitely go back again. Review #76:This was such a great, relaxing place to stay. The location couldn't be more perfect. We were able to walk down hill right to the heart of Rome, including the Spanish Steps, Via Veneto, and the Trevi Fountain. The uphill walk to the hotel was, however, brutal, especially after a day of touring Rome. So, we highly recommend you hire the private shuttle to take you to/from the Spanish Steps.

We stayed 3 nights at this superb hotel located in Villa Borghese (Rome parks). I'm here to recommend the hotel as a whole, not to say any thing about the 5 star Restaurant BA. Our rooms were clean and nice. we took the shuttle service for free to piazza Spagna from the Hotel from a place which is only 5 minutes away. Our main objective, which was the main reason we chose a hotel in that area, was to visit Villa Borghese and to do the walking tours to Villa Medici, Piazza di Spagna & Trevi Fountain. We also managed to visit the Coloseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon. We took different walking tours with our hotel staff, in the evening at the Spanish steps. It was a perfect package for us. In any way we must say thanks to the hotel staffs who helped us plan and choose the hotel and the shuttle. Review #75:The Aldrovandi is a beautiful, elegant, and modern hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much and were happy that the hotel was outside the city - the Borghese Garden was a peaceful and calming respite from Rome's heat and crowds. The restaurant was outstanding and the concierge was very helpful indeed. We would not hesitate to go back and recommended the hotel to everyone we met.

We had breakfast at the hotel each morning, which was included in our room rate, and my husband and I enjoyed the many continental choices available as well as the waffle maker. As for the complimentary breakfast, it was delicious, with both Italian and Continental foods to choose from. Aside from that, we ordered room service a couple times and enjoyed the variety of options available, and as far as the two restaurants in the hotel, we didn't eat there, but others mentioned that the one Michelin-star-rated restaurant called Baby was quite good. Review #74:This location is at the edge of Villa Borghese, a 4 minute car ride away from the Trevi fountain. The staff is outstanding as is the decor, pool, bathrooms, rooms, and restaurants. Breakfast buffet was fine but a bit pricey. However, the lunch and dinner provided in Baby was amazing, as was the service and atmosphere. Rooms were clean and spacious and we felt very comfortable there. The hotel is a little ways outside the center (cab fare from airport is around 75 Euros), however the shuttle that takes you to Spanish Steps is great and every hour. If you want to walk to piazza del Popolo or Via Veneto, it is a 20 minute walk away from the hotel. Otherwise, you can easily take a cab to wherever you need to go. Highly recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning in the future. Review #75:We had wonderful and friendly service. Breakfast and lunch were a bit expensive, but tasty.
