The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has statutory authority to determine the volume amounts after 2022.\nThe total renewable fuel statutory target consists of both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. Since 2014, the total renewable fuel statutory target has not been met, with the advanced biofuel portion falling below the statutory target by a large margin since 2015. Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute.\nEPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS\u2014whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs).\nCongress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things. Some assert it is time to amend or repeal the RFS, while others contend the best course of action is to maintain the status quo. For instance, some Members contend the RFS hurts consumers by creating an artificial market for ethanol. Others see ethanol as a part of a competitive energy strategy.\nCongress may also express interest in how the EPA Administrator applies the RFS \"reset\" authority.

The mandated minimum volume increases annually and must be met using a combination of conventional biofuel (e.g., corn starch ethanol), advanced biofuel (e.g., cellulosic ethanol), and other biofuels such as biomass-based diesel.\nA variety of factors, such as infrastructure, technology, and limited federal assistance, have led to challenges in meeting the total volume requirement established by Congress. These include a lack of cellulosic biofuel production, delays by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in approving fuel pathways, and fluctuating gasoline prices that can impact the biofuel or conventional fuel industries.\nSince 2014, two advanced biofuel pathways\u2014renewable compressed natural gas and renewable liquefied natural gas\u2014have constituted the majority of the cellulosic biofuel volume target, further increasing the importance of these pathways in meeting the overall RFS targets.\nThe final rule for the RFS for 2019, released in November 2018, calls for 19.92 billion gallons of total renewable fuel, an increase of 1% from the previous year's requirement. However, some stakeholders have raised questions about the transparency of the market wherein credits are traded, and whether the administration's release of multiple small refinery exemptions has adversely affected biofuel demand.\nImplementing the RFS has been complex, leading to some general concerns about the administering agency, qualifying biofuels for the RFS, cellulosic biofuel production, and other factors. Policy discussions are ongoing in Congress about possible modifications or alternatives to the RFS, which could involve eliminating or amending the conventional biofuel segment of the mandate.\nThe report briefly explains the statutory compliance process, how EPA regulates compli ance with the RFS using a tradable credit system, and challenges around implementing the RFS and achieving annual volume targets.

{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "Concurrent receipt refers to the simultaneous receipt of two types of federal monetary benefits: military retired pay and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation. Prior to 2004, existing laws and regulations dictated that a military retiree could not receive two payments from federal agencies for the same purpose. As a result, military retirees with physical disabilities recognized by the VA would have their military retired pay offset or reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of their nontaxable VA compensation. Legislative activity on the issue of concurrent receipt began in the late 1980s and culminated in the provision for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314). Since then, Congress has added Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for those retirees with a disability rated at 50% or greater, extended concurrent receipt to additional eligible populations, and further refined and clarified the program.\nThere are two common criteria that define eligibility for concurrent receipt: (1) all recipients must be military retirees and (2) they must also be eligible for VA disability compensation. An eligible retiree cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC. The retiree must choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may change the type of benefit to be received during an annual open season.\nIn FY2017, approximately one-third of the retired military population was receiving either CRSC or CRDP at a cost of $12.4 billion. Nevertheless, there are also military retirees who receive VA disability compensation but are not eligible for concurrent receipt. Determining whether to make some or all of this population eligible for concurrent receipt remains a point of contention in Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that to extend benefits to all veterans who would be eligible for both disability benefits and military retired pay would cost $30 billion from 2015 to 2024. In 2016, CBO estimated that eliminating concurrent receipt would save the government $139 billion between 2018 and 2026.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

In recent years, the federal government has annually made available more than $100 billion in federal grants, loans, and work-study funds to millions of students to help cover the cost of higher education. As Congress continues to focus on expanding access to postsecondary education through federal student aid policies, understanding various characteristics of the population enrolling in postsecondary education may be useful for policy deliberations.\nThis report focuses on the income of the undergraduate student population. It analyzes (1) how the income distribution of the undergraduate population has changed over time; (2) the relationship between student income and certain student demographics, such as race and dependency status; and (3) how the income distribution of the undergraduate population compares with that of the population of persons who do not have a postsecondary degree. Major findings presented in this report include the following:\nThe number and proportion of low-income students has increased in more recent years, even as total enrollment has decreased. Low-income student enrollment has increased at a faster pace than the nation's population of low-income persons. The majority of students enrolling in postsecondary education have incomes below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Independent undergraduate students who have sometimes been labeled as \"non-traditional\" constitute a large portion of enrolled postsecondary students and tend to have lower income than more \"traditional\" students. Nonwhite students account for nearly 50% of the undergraduate student population, and they tend to have lower income than white students. The majority of low-income students attend community colleges and a disproportionately high share attend private for-profit institutions.\nThe changing composition of the student population could have implications for federal policies designed to promote access to postsecondary education. In particular, policymakers face consideration of whether federal policies could play a role in encouraging students at various income levels to enroll at the highest performing types of schools.

The Supreme Court has recognized that the right to bail is essential for unhampered preparation of a defense and prevention of inflicting punishment before conviction. Nonetheless, the Court has held that the government may have legitimate interests in limiting the availability of bail, including possible flight risk, danger to public safety, or specific members of the community. The Court has also observed that pretrial detention may have negative consequences for criminal defendants, such as impaired ability to maintain employment and financial support for the dependents.\nMoney bail systems allow defendants to avoid jail by posting a bond according to a fee schedule. Typically, judges set bail based on the nature of the offense with no assessment of individual characteristics. States and municipalities use money-bail systems in the absence of clear statutory guidance, permitting broad discretion for judges in determining the conditions for releasing prisoners.\nCritics argue that money-bail systems unduly burden indigent defendants, who face more difficulty paying bail compared to non-indigent defendants accused of a similar offense. Supporters contend that money-bail systems uniformly treat defendants and ensure they will appear in subsequent proceedings.\nRecently, defendants have challenged the constitutionality of state and local money-bail systems, particularly as they apply to indigent defendants. The Department of Justice, under the Obama and Trump Administrations, has played an active role in litigation challenging local bail systems.\nThe Constitution governs pretrial detention and bail.

In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.\nThe LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers' compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

This act also provides survivors benefits to the families of deceased workers.\nThe LHWCA was enacted in 1927 to provide coverage for workers in maritime occupations who were not covered by state workers' compensation laws due to constitutional limitations. The program has been modified four times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law, including coverage under the Defense Base Act for military and public works contractors, and coverage under the LHWCA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for workers employed on offshore vessels.\nThe LHWCA provides medical benefits to cover all aspects of treatment for covered injuries or illnesses. It also provides disability benefits to partially cover the wages lost due to covered injuries or illnesses, and survivors benefits to the families of workers who die on the job. The amount of disability benefits is based on the worker's pre-disability wage and is subject to maximum and minimum benefits based on the National Average Weekly Wage.\nThe LHWCA program is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), but the insurance aspects of the law are the primary means of providing LHWCA benefits. Insurance carriers provide benefits to injured, sick, and deceased workers and their families, with private insurers, self-insured employers, or the DOL's own Special Fund providing the financial resources. Administrative costs associated with the LHWCA program are largely financed by general revenue, while the DOL's Special Fund covers costs associated with vocational rehabilitation activities.\n. \n ", "evaluation": "rouge"}
{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "The United States Fire Administration (USFA)\u2014which includes the National Fire Academy (NFA)\u2014is currently housed within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance.\nOn January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023.\nMeanwhile, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level. Additionally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and the National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.
