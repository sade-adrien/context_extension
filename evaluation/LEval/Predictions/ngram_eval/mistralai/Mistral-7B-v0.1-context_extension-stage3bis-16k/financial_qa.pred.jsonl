The first challenge I will discuss in regard to the macroeconomic landscape is the uncertainty that prevails in the economic climate. The economic uncertainty, coupled with the recent change in administration, has led to less capital available for expansion. 3. The second challenge I will discuss in relation to the macroeconomic landscape is the increased cost of materials that the company needs to source to produce its products. This has contributed to the increase in the cost of its supplies, which it has had to absorb because the price offered to the customers is not flexible. 4. In regard to the microeconomic landscape, I will highlight the increase in the number of companies that Theragenics compete with in the area that it is operating. This means that Theragenics has to come up with ways to increase competition. 5. To address the challenges highlighted above, Theragenics has come up with strategies. One of the strategies is to enhance its product portfolio. This strategy will involve developing new product lines that will meet the needs of the medical device market. 6. Another strategy the company has adopted is to focus on product quality. This means improving the quality of the products that it currently has in the market. The company will achieve this by investing in its research and development department. 7. Theragenics also has plans to lower its cost by implementing a cost-cutting initiative.

I'll be happy to answer that. Our EPS was at a negative $0.38 for the quarter.

And Cam walked through some of them in his part of the call, the other one is that obviously for us we are an up and down company. And certainly Q-1 of 2010 was a time for us when we had a fairly significant accounting gain, which was from the amendments to our Visudyne agreements and so that was a factor as well, so I think those would be the two main items that we had that would have influenced our bottom-line results for the quarter.

As I mentioned in the call I am cautiously optimistic about the impact of the plug on that program, the sales force has ramped up significantly even though we still are not as full as I think we want to be, especially given the slow start in the fourth quarter; we're still advancing the trial. We're still advancing it quickly. I think we'll pick up the pace significantly as we go into the first quarter of 2011. We're really at the stage right now of the beginning of the full ramp-up of the plug program. And I think the plug with the other chemistry is doing very well even though it's very early. There are clinical advisors who we are working with in the field, as well as some clinical study sites and those are progressing steadily and well. So it's very, very early days as it relates to that plug, but we're very very encouraged with the progress we've made on that one so far.
