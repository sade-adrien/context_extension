However, let me summarize the inventions. The European patent application EP 3 238 476 discloses methods of treating dough with amylase enzymes to enhance the moistness of baked products, especially in the form of sponge cakes and unit cakes. The application also mentions baking procedures for preparing cakes with the addition of yeast and describes the conditions under which the methods may be employed in preparing dough made with spices as well as high ratio unit cakes, among other things. \nThe inventors are interested in anti-staling baked products, preferably cakes with extended shelf life due to moistness, and have identified three types of enzymes: fungal \u03b1-amylase, bacterial \u03b1-amylase and maltogenic \u03b1-amylase, with the particular focus on the third mentioned enzyme, which is based on the SEQ ID NO: 1 peptide sequence. This sequence corresponds to the SEQ ID NO: 1 amino acid sequence disclosed by M. B. Bokken, X-Ray diffraction analysis of a putative alpha-amylase from a thermo-tolerant Bacillus sp. Arch Microbiol, 117 (1976), 25-30, but no patent is cited as the source of the sequence. \nIn the examples it is described how fungal \u03b1-amylases and maltogenic \u03b1-amylases may lack certain properties compared to the inventors' enzymes under discussion. The following differences are stated: \nThe fungal \u03b1-amylase used in the comparative experiments (from  A. oryzae ) is more sensitive to heat treatment than the maltogenic \u03b1-amylase (from  B. amyloliquefaciens ), and is not effective as far as staling of the cakes is concerned. \nThe fungal \u03b1-amylase from  A. oryzae  and maltogenic \u03b1-amylase from  B. amyloliquefaciens  have been shown to be suitable for treatment of yeasted doughs made with spices, but have been shown to lack certain", "evaluation": "rouge"}
