(Ruff et al., 2018) trained a deep neural network to map data into a minimum volume hypersphere. Generative probabilistic novelty detection (GPND) (Pidhorskyi et al., 2018) employed the distance to the latent data manifold as the confidence measure and trained the adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to model the manifold. Deep generative models are widely employed for latent space modeling in OOD detection (Zenati et al., 2018; Sabokrou et al., 2018). However, a recent paper by Nalisnick et al.

While adversarially trained generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or AAE, are not discussed in Nalisnick et al.

They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important. I am happy to increase my score if the experiments suggests are added to the work.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

(2014), substantial progress has been done to improve the accuracy of supervised depth estimation from monocular images, including the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Li et al., 2015), joint optimization of surface normals (Qi et al., 2018), fusion of multiple depth maps (Lee et al., 2018), and ordinal classification (Fu et al., 2018). Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos. Rapid progress in terms of architectures and objective functions (Yin & Shi, 2018; Mahjourian et al., 2018; Casser et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Klodt & Vedaldi, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) have since then turned monocular depth estimation into one of the most successful applications of self-supervised learning, even outperforming supervised methods (Guizilini et al., 2019). The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible. It will be an interesting future work to clearly delineate the boundary between convergence and non-convergence.\n\n* In Thm 2 and Claim 3, what happens if dimension $d_0$ is smaller? What is the reason that you had to restrict it to high dimension? Is it due to high variance with few samples?\n\n* In Thm 2, constants $d\u2019_0$ and $a$ hide the dependence of the result on p, but I would suggest stating the dependence of those parameters on p, and also dependence on other parameters such as N.\n\n* In Section 5, there is a statement \u201cThis negative result, a theoretical manifestation of the \u201cvanishing gradient problem\u201d, is circumvented by balanced initialization.\u201d Can you elaborate more on that? If my understanding is correct, there is still $\\sigma_min$ multiplier in Eq (9), which means that at near-zero regions, the gradient will still vanish.\n\n7: Good paper, accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Bayesian Compression and Structured Bayesian Pruning (Louizos et al., 2017; Neklyudov et al., 2017) extend Sparse VD to prune whole neurons or filters via groupsparsity constraints. Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al. (2017) learn dropout rates by using a continuous relaxation of dropout\u2019s discrete masks (via the concrete distribution). The authors learn layer-wise dropout rates, which does not allow for dropout-rate-based pruning.

A part of this literature is concerned with learning to solve new tasks without catastrophically forgetting how to solve old ones (Zenke et al., 2017; Kirkpatrick et al., 2016). The use of modules obviates this problem, but instead shifts the hard question to one of how newly-allocated modules can be learned effectively. The continual learning literature also directly addresses knowlege transfer to newly allocated structures (Chen et al., 2015; Rusu et al., 2016; Fernando et al., 2017), but largely addresses how transfer learning can lead to higher performance, rather than addressing how it can improve learning speed.

Starting by studying the bias of the IWAE bound for approximating log-marginal likelihood, the authors propose to make use of debiasing techniques to improve the approximation. For the binarized MNIST the authors show improved approximations given the same number of samples from the auxiliary distribution q(z|x).\n\nJVI seems to be an interesting extension of, and perspective on, the IWAE bound (and other Monte Carlo objectives). Some questions and comments:\n\n* The Cremer et al. (2017) paper contains some errors when interpreting the IWAE bound as a standard ELBO with a more flexible variational approximation distribution. For example eq. (1) in their paper does not correspond to an actual distribution, it is not properly normalized. This makes the connection in their section 2.1 unclear. I would suggest citing the following paper instead for this connection and the relation to importance sampling (IS):\nNaesseth, Linderman, Ranganath, Blei, \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\", 2017.\n\n* Regarding the analysis of the IWAE bound the paper by Rainforth et al. (2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al. (2017) paper it is possible to make use of a standard Taylor approximation/delta methods to derive Prop. 1 and Prop. 2, see e.g. Robert & Casella, \"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods\" or Liu's \"Monte Carlo Strategies for Scientific Computing\".\n\n* It could be worth mentioning that the JVI objective function is now no longer (I think?) a lower bound to the log-evidence.\n\n* Could the surprising issue (IWAE-learned, JV1-evaluated being better than JV1-learned, JV1-evaluated) in Table 1 be because of different local optima?\n\n* Also, we can easily get unbiased estimates of the evidence p(x) using IS and optimize this objective wrt to model parameters. The proposal parameters can be optimized to minimize variance, how do you think this compares to the proposed method?\n\nMinor comments:\n* p(x) -> p_\\theta(x)\n* In the last paragraph of section 1 it seems like you claim that the expressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z) is a limitation of VAE.

Consider, for example, the trade-off between thermal resistance, electrical conductivity, and mechanical stability needed to design a nano-porous template with optimal thermoelectric efficiency. To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution. The main challenges come from the black-box nature of those physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linear PDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches. The first approach exploits zero-order approximation of gradients in the Langevin Sampling and we refer to it as Zero-Order Langevin. In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers. The second approach approximates the gradients in the Langevin dynamics with deep neural networks, allowing us an efficient sampling strategy using the surrogate model.

They consider the specific situation where the constraints are a solution of a complicated PDE solver and hence the derivatives or specific functional forms of the constraint cannot be obtained.

The non error gradient part of this analysis has been established before and the authors mention the references appropriately. I have a couple of questions regarding the precise statements of the theorem that i will ask towards the end of the review. Overall its hard to comment on the tightness of the analysis as the non-error versions are also unclear of the tightness of the bounds. Nevertheless the bounds achieved do not look much worse than the non-error counterparts and are easy to implement. The rest of the bounds focus on achieving low error in approximation of the gradients in various settings. Overall the theory in this part seems very loose in terms of bounds as exponential factors in dimensions start to appear and in that regard seems quite preliminary but its hard to comment on whether its natural or can be improved. \n\nSome questions I have regarding the theorem statements \n\nRegarding theorem 1 SPLMC convergence  (and corollaries of the theorem) -  I find it surprising that there is no lower bound assumption on eta in terms of K - only an upper bound. This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty.

Sequential Monte Carlo (Liu & Chen, 1998) approximates the posterior by a set of particles. Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) (Maybeck, 1982) and Bayesian online learning (Opper, 1998) are deterministic posterior approximations based on moment matching. Other deterministic approaches are based on Laplace\u2019s approximation (MacKay, 1992): Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) use multiple diagonal Gaussian posterior approximations of previous time-steps to regularise future tasks; Ritter et al. (2018) use a single (block-diagonal) posterior approximation, summarising all previous time-steps. The latter method is closer to Bayesian online inference, as it is an approximation of Eq. (1). Our work is based on online VB (Opper, 1998; Ghahramani, 2000; Sato, 2001; Broderick et al., 2013), which approximates the posterior at every time-step by minimising the KL-divergence between a parametric (here Gaussian) and the true posterior distribution. In contrast to online VB, we approximate the posterior by a Gaussian distribution and a running memory. Other approaches are based on various types of episodic memory, motivated by their empirical success in preventing catastrophic forgetting. The basic idea of rehearsal (Ratcliff, 1990) is to train on both the new data and a subset of previous data or pseudo samples (Robins, 1995; Shin et al., 2017; Kemker & Kanan, 2017) sampled from a generative model.

Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters?

Tensor methods also allow to produce more accurate and robust recommender systems by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments (Frolov & Oseledets, 2017). In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Conventional regularization methods have rarely been applied in deep RL. One rare case of such use is in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2016), where Batch Normalization is applied to all layers of the actor \u00b5 network and layers of the critic Q network prior to the action input, and L2 regularization is applied to the critic Q network because it tends to have overestimation bias (Fujimoto et al., 2018). Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al. (2019) introduces TD error regularization to penalize inaccurate value estimation and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2016) regularization to penalize GAE variance. However, most of these regularizations are rather complicated (Galashov et al., 2019), specifically designed for certain algorithms (Parisi et al., 2019), or need prior information (Cheng et al., 2019).

In DRL, regularization can be applied to the policy network, the value network, or both.\n\nL2 and L1 regularization are two common regularization methods used in DRL. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the weights of the network to have small magnitudes. L1 regularization adds a penalty term that encourages the weights of the network to have small magnitudes and also adds a penalty term that encourages the weights of the network to have small L1 norms. Weight clipping is another regularization method that adds a penalty term that encourages the weights of the network to have small magnitudes. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly drops out some of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Batch Normalization (BN) is a regularization method that adds a normalization step to the network to improve the stability of the training process. Entropy regularization is a regularization method that encourages the policy network to output a probability distribution over actions, rather than a single action.\n\nIn this work, we conducted a comprehensive study of common regularization methods in DRL. We found that L2 regularization is the most effective method for all algorithms and tasks we evaluated. L1 regularization and weight clipping can also be useful in some cases. BN and dropout can be useful in off-policy algorithms, but not on-policy algorithms. Regularization can be effective on both easy and hard tasks, with the performance boost being more significant on harder tasks.

Notably, models with multi-head attention such as Transformer have demonstrated extreme effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in a variety of sequence modeling tasks.

However, they suffer from two major problems: gradient vanishing and sequential nature of forward and backward passes. To address these problems, recent works have completely jettisoned RNNs and instead rely on convolution operation or attention mechanism that are easy to parallelize. Two representative models that have drawn great attention are Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN) and Transformer. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence learning model, termed as R-Transformer, that is a multi-layer architecture built on RNNs and the standard Transformer. The proposed model has three components that are organized hierarchically and the architecture of the layer structure is shown in Figure 1. As shown in the figure, the lower level is the local recurrent neural networks that are designed to model local structures in a sequence; the middle level is a multi-head attention that is able to capture global long-term dependencies; and the upper level is a position-wise feedforward networks which conduct a non-linear feature transformation. Next, we describe each level in detail. 3.1 LOCALRNN: MODELING LOCAL STRUCTURES In this subsection, we propose to take the advantage of RNNs to achieve this. Unlike previous works where RNNs are often applied to the whole sequence, we instead reorganize the original long sequence into many short sequences which only contain local information and are processed by a shared RNN independently and identically. In particular, we construct a local window of sizeM for each target position such that the local window includes M consecutive positions and ends at the target position. Thus, positions in each local window form a local short sequence, from which the shared RNN will learn a latent representation. In this way, the local structure information of each local region of the sequence is explicitly incorporated in the learned latent representations. We refer to the shared RNN as LocalRNN. Comparing to original RNN operation, LocalRNN only focuses on local short-term dependencies without considering any long-term dependencies. Figure 2 shows the different between original RNN and LocalRNN operations.

While its design is appealing and it has been successfully applied in various tasks, several problems caused by its recursive structures including low computation efficiency and gradient exploding or vanishing make it ineffective when learning long sequences. Therefore, in recent years, a lot of efforts has been made to develop models\nwithout recursive structures and they can be roughly divided into two categories depending whether they rely on convolutions operations or not. The first category includes models that mainly built on convolution operations. For example, van den Oord et al. have designed an autoregressive WaveNet that is based on causal filters and dilated convolution to capture both global and local information in raw audios (Van Den Oord et al., 2016). Ghring et al. has successfully replace traditional RNN based encoder and decoder with convolutional ones and outperforms LSTM setup in neural machine translation tasks (Gehring et al., 2017; 2016).

However, I have major concerns regarding the novelty this paper, the various claims it makes, as well as its experiment setting.\n\nMajor issues/questions:\n1. The techniques proposed by this paper lack novelty. For instance, the entire section 3.2 is simply the original design of the multi-head self-attention by Vaswani et al. The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below). Moreover, some prior works have already exploited the locality structure in Transformers. For instance, [1] showed that a sparse, local Transformer can work extremely well and be very efficient (they achieved SOTA on large-scale char-level language modeling tasks).\n\n2. The experiments do not entirely convince me. \n    i) The authors use the \"same hidden size for R-Transformer and Transformer.\" But in fact, as the R-Transformer has one extra RNN/LSTM/GRU layer at every level of the network, the tests were carried out (in effect) using a larger model than the baselines. I think the authors should instead control the # of model parameters, especially since you are running only on small tasks with small-sized models.\n    ii) It is nice that the authors tested R-Transformer on a variety of tasks--- this is important. However, in no way do these number achieve the levels of the \"state-of-the-art\", which the authors claim at the end of Section 1 (e.g., [2] has better number on seqMNIST and character-level PTB, and the Transformer-XL actually achieves <55 perplexity on word-level PTB). Therefore, the numbers don't look particularly appealing to me. \n    iii) Lack of more challenging, or large-scale experiments.\n    iv) Lack of ablative study. \n\n3. The authors claim that the finite-window RNN captures local features. But doesn't that claim only applies to the first layer?

This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer.

The algorithm is motivated by two criteria: i) the policy should act similarly to the expert within the expert's data distribution, and ii) the policy should move towards the expert's data distribution outside of it.

Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015).

In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

GuessWhat is one of the famous taskoriented dialog tasks, where the goal is to figure out a target object in the image through a dialog that the answerer has in mind (de Vries et al., 2017). However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%. In the object guessing task (i.e., GuessWhat task itself), the state-of-the-art averaged accuracy of SL, RL (Zhang et al., 2018b), and AQM (Lee et al., 2018) reached 44.6% and 60.8%, and 72.9% at the 5th round, respectively. Random guessing baseline has an accuracy of\n16.0% (Han et al., 2017), thus RL algorithms achieve 53.3% error decrease, whereas AQM achieves 67.7%. GuessWhich is a cooperative two-player game that one player tries to figure out an image out of 9,628 that another has in mind (Das et al., 2017b). GuessWhich uses Visual Dialog dataset (Das et al., 2017a) which includes human dialogs on MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014) as well as the captions that are generated. Although GuessWhich is similar to GuessWhat, it is more challenging in every task including asking a question, giving an answer, and guessing the target class. For example, unlike GuessWhat that can be answered in yes or no, the answer can be an arbitrary sentence in GuessWhich. Therefore, the VQA task in the Visual Dialog dataset is much studied than the GuessWhat dataset (Lu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2017b). Similar to GuessWhat, SL and RL approaches have been applied to solve the GuessWhich task and they showed a moderate increase in performance (Das et al., 2017b; Jain et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). However, based on the authors\u2019 recent Github implementation1 of the papers in ICCV (Das et al., 2017b), SL and RL methods have shown that only 6% of error is diminished through the dialog compared to the zeroth turn baselines which only use generated caption.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. \n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth. The terse nature of the content makes it hard to follow in general. If someone apriori was not familiar with task-oriented dialog or the visual dialog setting in Das et al. (2017b), it would be quite hard to follow.\n- While mentioning SL/RL approaches while comparing or introducing the setup, the authors do not make any distinction between discriminative and generative dialog models. Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd. Assuming, this to be Qbot\u2019s mental model of Abot -- there is no prior reason why this should be initialized or trained in such a manner. Similarly, the training paradigm of the depA setting is confusing.

Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

Recent studies (Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) show that learned RL policies can be easily misled with small perturbations in observations. The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). However, these robust RL algorithms mainly focus on noisy vision observations, instead of the observed rewards. A couple of recent works (Lim et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2017) have also looked into a rather parallel question of training robust RL algorithms with uncertainty in models. Learning with Noisy Data Learning appropriately with biased data has received quite a bit of attention in recent machine learning studies Natarajan et al. (2013); Scott et al. (2013); Scott (2015); Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014); van Rooyen & Williamson (2015); Menon et al. (2015). The idea of above line of works is to define unbiased surrogate loss function to recover the true loss using the knowledge of the noises. We adapt these approaches to reinforcement learning. Though intuitively the idea should apply in our RL settings, our work is the first one to formally establish this extension both theoretically and empirically. Our quantitative understandings will provide practical insights when implementing reinforcement learning algorithms in noisy environments.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "the paper focuses on an interesting and relatively unexplored direction for RL. Apart from the work cited by the paper (and perhaps work like Krueger et al. (2016), in which agents must pay some cost to observe true rewards), there is little work on learning settings of this kind. This paper represents a first step in gaining clarity on how to formalize and study this problem. I did, however, find the analysis and the experiments to be relatively disjointed -- the main sample complexity result presented by the paper (Theorem 2) was given for Phased Q-Learning, yet no experiments actually evaluate the performance of Phased Q-Learning. I think the paper could benefit from experiments focused on simple domains that showcase how traditional algorithms do in cases where it is easier to understand (and visualize) the impact of the reward perturbations (simple chain MDPs, grid worlds, etc.) -- and specifically experiments including Phased Q-Learning. \n\nSection 1) Introduction:\n\t- \"adversaries in real-world\" --> \"adversaries in the real-world\"\n\t- You might consider citing Loftin et al. (2014) regarding the bulleted point about \"Application-Specific Noise\".\n\t- \"unbiased reward estimator aided reward robust reinforcement learning framework\" --> this was a bit hard to parse. Consider making more concise, like: \"unbiased reward estimator for use in reinforcement learning with perturbed rewards\".\n\t- \"Our solution framework builds on existing reinforcement learning algorithms, including the recently developed DRL ones\" --> cite these up front So, cite: Q-Learning, CEM, SARSA, DQN, Dueling DQN, DDPG, NAF, and PPO, and spell out the acronym for each the first time you introduce them.\n\t- \"layer of explorations\" --> \"layer of exploration\"\n\nSection 2) Problem Formulation\n\t- \"as each shot of our\" --> what is 'shot' in this context?\n\t- \"In what follow,\" --> \"In what follows,\"\n\t- \"where 0 < \\gamma \\leq 1\" --> Usually, $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$, or $[0,1]$. Why can't $\\gamma = 0$?\n\t- The transition notation changes between $\\mathbb{P}_a(s_{t+1} | s_t)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$. I'd suggest picking one and sticking with it to improve clarity.\n\t- \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" --> Why is the Q-function just an example? Isn't is *the* state-action value function? That is, I'd suggest replacing \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" with \"to learn a state-action value function, also called the Q-function\"\n\t- \"Q-function calculates\" --> \"The Q-function denotes\"\n\t- \"the reward feedbacks perfectly\" --> \"the reward feedback perfectly\"\n\t- I prefer that the exposition of the perturbed reward MDP be done with C in the tuple. So: $\\tilde{M} = \\langle \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{R}, C, \\mathcal{P}, \\gamma \\rangle$. This seems the most appropriate definition, since the observed rewards will be generated by $C$.\n\t- The setup of the confusion matrix for reward noise over is very clean. It might be worth pointing out that $C$ need not be Markovian. There are cases where C is not just a function of $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$, like the adversarial case you describe early on.\n\n\n4) Experiments:\n\t- Diverse experiments! That's great. Lots of algorithms, lots of environment types.\n\t- I expected to see Phrased Q-Learning in the experiments. Why was it not included?\n\t- The plots are pretty jagged, so I'm left feeling a bit skeptical about some of the results. The results would be strengthened if the experiments were repeated for more trials.\n\n6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Wang et al. (2018) proposed a Reinforced Ranker-Reader model that ranks retrieved evidence and assigns different weights to evidence prior to processing by the reader. Min et al. (2018) demonstrated that for several popular MRC datasets (e.g. SQuAD, TriviaQA) most questions can be answered using only a few sentences rather than the entire document. Motivated by this observation, they built a sentence selector to gather this potential evidence for use by the reader model. Nishida et al. (2018) developed a multi-task learning (MTL) method for a retriever and reader in order to obtain a strong retriever that considers certain passages including the answer text as positive samples during training. The proposed MTL framework is still limited to the scenario when it is feasible to discover whether the passages contain the answer span. Although these works have achieved progress on open-domain QA by improving the ranking or selection of given evidence, few have focused on the scenario where the model needs to start by searching for the evidence itself. Scientific Question Answering (SQA) is a representative open-domain task that requires capability in both retrieval and reading comprehension. In this paper, we study question answering on the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) scientific QA dataset (Clark et al., 2018).

The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me.

However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions.

Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision. For example, using REINFORCE to learn the selector model with the rewards from the end-task performance.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The subject of how a given algorithm explores the landscape is still a poorly understood area in training neural networks. There is a large body of recent work that attempts to shed light on this puzzle, and each one tries to claim their share in the furthering of the understanding of the relationship between the geometry of the landscape and the dynamics that one chooses in optimization. The present paper is a fine addition to the literature with interesting observations and novel questions, however, it falls short in many core areas: An apparent work in progress that has a great potential. \n\nA major question (that I hope will easily be addressed) is on the definition of the barrier itself. According to the text, a barrier is defined judging by the minima of two 1-dimensional segments that connect weights connecting three consecutive steps: if the minimum of the line segment defined by the latter step is larger than the former, then it declared that a barrier is crossed. In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors use the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm as a proxy for diffusion in DNNs and show that SGD rarely crosses barriers during training. Instead, they propose an alternate mechanism that SGD uses to explore different regions of the non-convex loss landscape of DNNs. The authors also discuss the role of batch size in exploration and show that larger batch sizes lead to slower exploration due to an oscillation behavior of SGD.\n\nThe paper is well-structured and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear introduction to the problem of non-convex optimization in DNNs and the challenges it poses. They then describe the setup of their experiments and the tools they use to study the DNN loss surface along SGD's path. The results presented in the paper are interesting and provide new insights into the behavior of SGD during training.\n\nOne suggestion for future work is to investigate the effect of other optimization algorithms, such as Adam or RMSprop, on exploration in DNNs. Additionally, it would be interesting to study the exploration process in other types of loss functions, such as hinge loss or cross-entropy loss.\n\nAnother question that arises from the paper is how the authors determine the existence of barriers along the optimization path of SGD. While they use interpolation to approximate the loss surface between parameters before and after each update step, it is not clear how they determine whether a point in the parameter space interpolated between the parameters just before and after an update step crosses a barrier.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of deep learning and sheds light on the exploration process during training of DNNs. The results presented in the paper have important implications for understanding the behavior of SGD and for developing more effective optimization algorithms for DNNs.", "evaluation": "rouge"}
