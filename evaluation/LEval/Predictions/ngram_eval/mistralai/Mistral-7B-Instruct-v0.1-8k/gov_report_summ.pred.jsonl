The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has statutory authority to determine the volume amounts after 2022.\nThe total renewable fuel statutory target consists of both conventional biofuel and advanced biofuel. Since 2014, the total renewable fuel statutory target has not been met, with the advanced biofuel portion falling below the statutory target by a large margin since 2015. Going forward, it is unlikely that the United States will meet the total renewable fuel target as outlined in statute.\nEPA administers the RFS and is responsible for several tasks. For instance, within statutory criteria EPA evaluates which renewable fuels are eligible for the RFS program. Also, EPA establishes the amount of renewable fuel that will be required for the coming year based on fuel supply and other conditions although waiver authority in the statute allows the EPA Administrator to reduce the statutory volumes if necessary. Further, the statute requires that the EPA Administrator \"reset\" the RFS\u2014whereby the fuel volumes required for future years are modified by the Administrator if certain conditions are met. EPA monitors compliance for the RFS using a system of tradable credits referred to as renewable identification numbers (RINs).\nCongress has expressed ongoing interest in the RFS, particularly as the mandate relates to other legislative efforts (e.g., Reid Vapor Pressure requirements for ethanol-gasoline fuel blends containing greater than 10% ethanol, a national octane standard) and about oversight of the RIN market, among other things. Some assert it is time to amend or repeal the RFS, while others contend the best course of action is to maintain the status quo. For instance, some Members contend the RFS hurts consumers by creating an artificial market for ethanol. Others see ethanol as a part of a competitive energy strategy.\nCongress may also express interest in how the EPA Administrator applies the RFS \"reset\" authority.

The RFS was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and was later expanded in 2007. The RFS requires that a certain percentage of the fuel used in transportation in the United States be made up of biofuels. The percentage of biofuels required to be used in transportation is set to increase over time, with a goal of 15 billion gallons of biofuels being used in the United States by 2022.\nThe RFS is designed to reduce the United States' dependence on foreign oil and to promote the use of renewable energy sources. The RFS also aims to create jobs in rural areas and to support the development of new technologies and industries. However, the implementation of the RFS has been complex and has faced challenges.\nOne of the main challenges facing the RFS is the lack of infrastructure for the production and distribution of biofuels. The RFS requires that biofuels be produced and distributed through existing infrastructure, but this infrastructure is not always available in rural areas where many biofuels are produced. This has led to delays in the production and distribution of biofuels, and has made it difficult for biofuel producers to meet the RFS requirements.\nAnother challenge facing the RFS is the lack of demand for certain types of biofuels. For example, cellulosic biofuels, which are made from non-food feedstocks such as wood chips and agricultural waste, have not been widely adopted despite being a key component of the RFS. This is due in part to the lack of infrastructure for the production and distribution of cellulosic biofuels, as well as the high cost of producing these fuels compared to traditional biofuels such as corn starch ethanol.\nThe RFS also faces legal challenges.

{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "Concurrent receipt refers to the simultaneous receipt of two types of federal monetary benefits: military retired pay and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation. Prior to 2004, existing laws and regulations dictated that a military retiree could not receive two payments from federal agencies for the same purpose. As a result, military retirees with physical disabilities recognized by the VA would have their military retired pay offset or reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of their nontaxable VA compensation. Legislative activity on the issue of concurrent receipt began in the late 1980s and culminated in the provision for Combat-Related Special Compensation (CRSC) in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-314). Since then, Congress has added Concurrent Retirement and Disability Payments (CRDP) for those retirees with a disability rated at 50% or greater, extended concurrent receipt to additional eligible populations, and further refined and clarified the program.\nThere are two common criteria that define eligibility for concurrent receipt: (1) all recipients must be military retirees and (2) they must also be eligible for VA disability compensation. An eligible retiree cannot receive both CRDP and CRSC. The retiree must choose whichever is most financially advantageous to him or her and may change the type of benefit to be received during an annual open season.\nIn FY2017, approximately one-third of the retired military population was receiving either CRSC or CRDP at a cost of $12.4 billion. Nevertheless, there are also military retirees who receive VA disability compensation but are not eligible for concurrent receipt. Determining whether to make some or all of this population eligible for concurrent receipt remains a point of contention in Congress. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that to extend benefits to all veterans who would be eligible for both disability benefits and military retired pay would cost $30 billion from 2015 to 2024.

Eligibility for CRSC is based on two criteria: a disability that is \"attributable to an injury for which the member was awarded the Purple Heart\" and is not rated as less than a 10% disability by the VA, or a disability rating resulting from involvement in \"armed conflict,\" \"hazardous service,\" \"duty simulating war,\" or \"through an instrumentality of war.\" Retirees must apply for CRSC to their parent service, and the parent service is responsible for verifying that the disability is combat-related.\n\nCRDP is a program that provides a monthly payment to military retirees with at least a 50% disability, regardless of the cause of disability. The amount of retired pay that the retiree could have restored would vary from $100 to $750 per month, or the actual amount of the offset, whichever is less.

Major findings presented in this report include the following:\nThe number and proportion of low-income students has increased in more recent years, even as total enrollment has decreased. Low-income student enrollment has increased at a faster pace than the nation's population of low-income persons. The majority of students enrolling in postsecondary education have incomes below 200% of the poverty guidelines. Independent undergraduate students who have sometimes been labeled as \"non-traditional\" constitute a large portion of enrolled postsecondary students and tend to have lower income than more \"traditional\" students. Nonwhite students account for nearly 50% of the undergraduate student population, and they tend to have lower income than white students. The majority of low-income students attend community colleges and a disproportionately high share attend private for-profit institutions.\nThe changing composition of the student population could have implications for federal policies designed to promote access to postsecondary education.

{"query": "Please help me summarize this government report.", "gt": "The Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA) is a federal workers' compensation program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers. Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers' compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill on the job and survivors benefits to the families of covered workers who die on the job. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. In 2016, more than $1.4 billion in LHWCA benefits were paid to beneficiaries.\nCongress has extended the LHWCA provisions to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), persons who repair recreational vessels of any size were added to the LHWCA exemption list. In 2011, the DOL implemented this provision; since then, those regulations have proven controversial and numerous bills have been introduced to modify the regulatory definition to increase the number of workers exempted from the LHWCA.\nThe LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker's pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers' compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The LHWCA covers a wide range of occupations, including longshoremen, harbor workers, and other employees who work on the water. The act is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL), which is responsible for determining eligibility for benefits and setting the amount of compensation to be paid.\n\nThe LHWCA provides medical benefits to fully cover the cost of any medical treatment associated with a covered injury or illness. Vocational rehabilitation services are also provided to assist covered workers in returning to employment. Disability benefits are provided to partially cover wages lost due to the inability to work because of a covered injury or illness. Total disability benefits are provided in cases of total disability, and partial disability benefits are provided in cases of temporary or permanent partial disability. Survivors benefits are also provided to the families of workers who die on the job.\n\nThe LHWCA is a no-fault system, which means that employees are not required to prove that their employer was at fault for their injury or illness in order to receive benefits. Instead, the focus is on providing compensation to employees who are injured or become ill while working on the water. The act is funded through a combination of employer contributions and insurance premiums, as well as through a special fund that is financed through an annual assessment charged to employers and insurance carriers based on the previous year's claims.\n\nThe LHWCA has been amended several times to extend coverage to occupations outside the original scope of the law. In 1928, coverage was extended to employees of the District of Columbia, and in 1941, coverage was extended to military and public works contractors. In 1952, coverage was extended to civilian employees of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the armed forces, and in 1953, coverage was extended to employees working on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n\nOverall, the LHWCA is an important program that provides essential workers' compensation benefits to employees who are injured or become ill while working on the water.

The objective of the USFA is to significantly reduce the nation's loss of life from fire, while also achieving a reduction in property loss and nonfatal injury due to fire.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-6) provided $45.679 million for USFA, including $1.5 million in the FEMA Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for the National Emergency Training Center. For FY2020, the Administration requested $46.605 million, which includes $1.5 million transferred from the Procurement, Construction, and Improvements account for NETC campus renovations. The budget proposal would be a $1 million increase over the FY2019 level; the increase would fund further improvements to NETC facilities. The budget proposal does not include funding for State Fire Training Assistance.\nOn January 3, 2018, the President signed the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98). P.L. 115-98 extends the USFA authorization through FY2023. The authorization levels are the same as in the previous authorization: $76,490,890 each year for FY2017 through FY2023.\nMeanwhile, concerns over the federal budget deficit could impact future funding levels for the USFA. Debate over the USFA budget has focused on whether the USFA is receiving an appropriate level of funding to accomplish its mission, given that appropriations for USFA have consistently been well below the agency's authorized level. Additionally, an ongoing issue is the viability and status of the USFA and the National Fire Academy within the Department of Homeland Security.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.
