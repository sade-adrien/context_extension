The company delivered 8.3% CAGR through the worst recession in 40 years and found its customers intact, supportive, and patient as they ramped up for increased demand. The company's go-forward goal is to grow the top line and take cost out of operations.

The company also plans to continue to ramp up product development without spending outrageous sums in R&D.\n\nTheragenics intends to carve out and prosper in a segment of the market that's cluttered but not so cluttered that it can't succeed.
