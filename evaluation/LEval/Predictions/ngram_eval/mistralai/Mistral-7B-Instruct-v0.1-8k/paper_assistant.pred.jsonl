While adversarially trained generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) or AAE, are not discussed in Nalisnick et al.

They train a model f(x) to match the outputs of g_i(aug_i(x)), where g_i is a random network and aug_i is a particular type of augmentation. An example with high error in this task is treated as an out-of-distribution example. This work focuses on exploring blurring through SVD, where the smallest K singular values are set to 0, and K varies between different aug_i calls. They find that their method of consistently can achieve strong detection rates across multiple target-dataset pairs.\n\nComments:\n* The experimental results in this work are impressive, which introduces many more questions.\n* The model used for f and g is not mentioned in the text.\n* Figure 4 (left) suggests that the SVD-RND performs about the same between 10K and 50K examples. The level of robustness is surprising, but doesn\u2019t seem to square with intuition that more data ought to help. How little data can be used? In other words, extend the graph to the left. \n* The geometric transforms baseline is not fair, since SVD-RND uses multiple SVD transforms (b_train > 1) whereas the geometric transforms only have one. Please run a model with all the geometric transforms. This result is important for understanding whether the gains come from the particular transform (SVD) or the number of transforms used.\n* Following the spirit of the previous comment, what other data augmentations can be used in place of SVD? Typical image classification pipelines use a large variety of augmentations. I would suggest taking some augmentations from AutoAugment [1] and running RND on top of them.\n* An experiment that is missing is RND trained on blurred images. Is the blurring itself the important component, or is having multiple different heads important?\n* In general, I am confused about how a single head RND does not converge to 0 loss by learning the weights of g. This seems to be a simple optimization problem. The original RND paper avoided this problem by also using the network to learn a policy, but this does not exist in this approach.\n\nIn general, this work seems promising, but lacks proper ablations that elucidate what components of the method are important. I am happy to increase my score if the experiments suggests are added to the work.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Consequently, as supervised techniques for depth estimation advanced rapidly, the availability of largescale depth labels became a bottleneck, especially for outdoor applications. Garg et al. (2016) and Godard et al. (2017) provided an alternative self-supervised strategy involving stereo cameras, where Spatial Transformer Networks (Jaderberg et al., 2015) can be used to geometrically warp, in a differentiable way, the right image into a synthesized left image, using the predicted depth from the left image. The photometric consistency loss between the resulting synthesized and original left images can then be minimized in an end-to-end manner using a Structural Similarity term (Wang et al., 2004) and additional depth regularization terms. Following Godard et al. (2017) and Ummenhofer et al. (2017), Zhou et al. (2017) generalized this to the purely monocular setting, where a depth and a pose networks are simultaneously learned from unlabeled monocular videos. Rapid progress in terms of architectures and objective functions (Yin & Shi, 2018; Mahjourian et al., 2018; Casser et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2018; Klodt & Vedaldi, 2018; Wang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018) have since then turned monocular depth estimation into one of the most successful applications of self-supervised learning, even outperforming supervised methods (Guizilini et al., 2019). The introduction of semantic information to improve depth estimates has been explored in prior works, and can be broadly divided into two categories. The first one uses semantic (or instance) information to mask out or properly model dynamic portions of the image, which are not accounted for in the photometric loss calculation.

It\u2019s been shown that we get acceleration in some cases (e.g., $\\ell_p$ regression when $p>2$ [Arora et al. 18\u2019]), but some other results (e.g., [Shamir 18\u2019] mentioned in Section 5) show that GD on linear neural nets (when weight matrices are all scalar) suffer exponential (in depth) increase in convergence time at near zero region, due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. From my understanding, this paper circumvents this problem by assuming deficiency margin, because in the setting of [Shamir 18\u2019], deficiency margin means that the initialized product ($W_{1:N}$) has the same sign as $\\Phi$ and far enough from zero, so we don\u2019t have to pass through the near-zero region.\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll list specific concerns/questions/comments.\n* In my opinion, the statements about \u201cnecessity\u201d of two key assumptions are too strong, because the authors only provide counterexamples of non-convergence. As [Theorem 3, Shamir 18\u2019] shows (although in scalar case), even when the assumptions are not satisfied, a convergence rate $O(exp(N) * log(1/\\epsilon))$ is possible. It will be an interesting future work to clearly delineate the boundary between convergence and non-convergence.\n\n* In Thm 2 and Claim 3, what happens if dimension $d_0$ is smaller?

Bayesian Compression and Structured Bayesian Pruning (Louizos et al., 2017; Neklyudov et al., 2017) extend Sparse VD to prune whole neurons or filters via groupsparsity constraints. Additionally, in Bayesian Compression the required bit-precision per layer is determined via the posterior variance. In contrast to our method, Bayesian Compression does not explicitly enforce clustering of weights during training and thus requires bit-widths in the range between 5 and 18 bits. Extending our method to include group-constraints for pruning is an interesting direction for future work. Another Bayesian method for simultaneous network quantization and pruning is soft weight-sharing (SWS) (Ullrich et al., 2017), which uses a Gaussian mixture model prior (and a KL term without trainable parameters such that the KL term reduces to the prior entropy). SWS acts like a probabilistic version of k-means clustering with the advantage of automatic collapse of unnecessary mixture components. Similar to learning the codebooks in our method, soft weight-sharing learns the prior from the data, a technique known as empirical Bayes. We cannot directly compare against soft weight-sharing since the authors do not report results on ternary networks. Gal et al. (2017) learn dropout rates by using a continuous relaxation of dropout\u2019s discrete masks (via the concrete distribution). The authors learn layer-wise dropout rates, which does not allow for dropout-rate-based pruning.

Since then a large number of specialized flows with different computational requirements and flexibility have been constructed: inverse autoregressive flows (Kingma et al., 2016), masked autoregressive flows Papamakarios et al. (2017), and Householder flows (Tomczak & Welling, 2016). Another way to improve the flexibility of the variational family has been to use implicit models (Mohamed & Lakshminarayanan, 2016) for variational inference; this line of work includes adversarial variational Bayes (Mescheder et al., 2017), wild variational inference (Li & Liu, 2016), deep implicit models (Tran et al., 2017), implicit variational models (Husza\u0301r, 2017), and adversarial message passing approximations (Karaletsos, 2016).", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

It involves finding a family of distributions that maximizes a lower bound on the log-likelihood of the data. The most commonly used lower bound is the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which is based on the idea of minimizing the difference between the log-likelihood and the log-evidence. However, the ELBO has been shown to be a loose lower bound, and other methods such as the information-weighted average evidence (IWAE) and the Burda-Bengio-Welling (BBW) bound have been proposed to improve the accuracy of the estimates.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for estimating the log-evidence of a probability distribution using a generalized jackknife estimator. The jackknife estimator is a resampling method that involves taking a subset of the data and computing the estimate based on that subset. We generalize the jackknife estimator to the case of a family of distributions and use it to estimate the log-evidence of the family. We show that the generalized jackknife estimator is a tight lower bound on the log-evidence and that it can be used to improve the accuracy of the ELBO and IWAE estimators.\nWe also provide an analysis of the variance and bias of the generalized jackknife estimator and show that it has a lower bias than the ELBO and IWAE estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the generalized jackknife estimator on several examples and show that it can be used to improve the accuracy of the ELBO and IWAE estimators.\nOverall, our work provides a new method for estimating the log-evidence of a probability distribution using a generalized jackknife estimator.

Starting by studying the bias of the IWAE bound for approximating log-marginal likelihood, the authors propose to make use of debiasing techniques to improve the approximation. For the binarized MNIST the authors show improved approximations given the same number of samples from the auxiliary distribution q(z|x).\n\nJVI seems to be an interesting extension of, and perspective on, the IWAE bound (and other Monte Carlo objectives). Some questions and comments:\n\n* The Cremer et al. (2017) paper contains some errors when interpreting the IWAE bound as a standard ELBO with a more flexible variational approximation distribution. For example eq. (1) in their paper does not correspond to an actual distribution, it is not properly normalized. This makes the connection in their section 2.1 unclear. I would suggest citing the following paper instead for this connection and the relation to importance sampling (IS):\nNaesseth, Linderman, Ranganath, Blei, \"Variational Sequential Monte Carlo\", 2017.\n\n* Regarding the analysis of the IWAE bound the paper by Rainforth et al. (2017) mentioned in the comments seems very relevant. Also, because of the strong connection between IWAE and IS detailed in the Naesseth et al. (2017) paper it is possible to make use of a standard Taylor approximation/delta methods to derive Prop. 1 and Prop. 2, see e.g. Robert & Casella, \"Monte Carlo Statistical Methods\" or Liu's \"Monte Carlo Strategies for Scientific Computing\".\n\n* It could be worth mentioning that the JVI objective function is now no longer (I think?) a lower bound to the log-evidence.\n\n* Could the surprising issue (IWAE-learned, JV1-evaluated being better than JV1-learned, JV1-evaluated) in Table 1 be because of different local optima?\n\n* Also, we can easily get unbiased estimates of the evidence p(x) using IS and optimize this objective wrt to model parameters. The proposal parameters can be optimized to minimize variance, how do you think this compares to the proposed method?\n\nMinor comments:\n* p(x) -> p_\\theta(x)\n* In the last paragraph of section 1 it seems like you claim that the expressiveness of p_\\theta(x|z) is a limitation of VAE.

To that end, we leverage the posterior regularization framework and show that this constraint satisfaction problem can be formulated as sampling from a Gibbs distribution. The main challenges come from the black-box nature of those physical constraints, since they are obtained via solving highly non-linear PDEs. To overcome those difficulties, we introduce Surrogate-based Constrained Langevin dynamics for black-box sampling. We explore two surrogate approaches. The first approach exploits zero-order approximation of gradients in the Langevin Sampling and we refer to it as Zero-Order Langevin. In practice, this approach can be prohibitive since we still need to often query the expensive PDE solvers. The second approach approximates the gradients in the Langevin dynamics with deep neural networks, allowing us an efficient sampling strategy using the surrogate model.

This seems wrong particularly as the theorem as stated then allows eta to be set extremely small while K is finite, in which case there should be no convergence theorems at all. The condition on eta should be a theta(f (K)) for some f type of condition like in the second part of the theorem. I would suggest the authors to look into the theorem - or claify why this is the case. \n\nI am confused by the presentation of the Shi et al results as there is no penalty appearing for the approximation error due to an RKHS, only a finite sample penalty.

Summary:\nThis proposes considers neural networks training with non-stationary streaming data. To address online inference, the paper uses variational online updates and a running memory (coreset) summarising the data points seen so far, as recently used in the variational continual learning approach. First, the paper identifies a gap in this recent approach that coreset point selection process does not take into account the approximation quality. The paper develops a sound procedure to select the memory points, essentially to identify \u201cdifficult\u201d data points under the current posterior and put them into the running memory. Second, to handle \u201cconcept drift\u201d, the paper considers imposing some decaying on the likelihood of past data and derives post-hoc variational posterior updates for this case. Two contributions are validated on some streaming regression and classification tasks.\n\n2. Opinion and rationales\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards \u201caccept\u201d for this paper since it presents two interesting contributions (albeit of incremental novelty)  to the approximate inference area, it has clear execution and super clean presentation, and the experiments clearly demonstrate the values of the proposed approaches.\n\nI would like the paper to clarify the following:\n\na. I find the objective for selecting memory points interesting, but am wondering if using individual predictability terms by themselves are good enough to select these points. Perhaps, after some thoughts, memory is perhaps not the right word to characterise these points. \n\nIt seems to me (i) these terms indicate how well the current posterior predicts the data points and thus this objective will tend to favour points with low predictive likelihood to be selected. That is, these points are important when *all other points* are presented, (ii) there will be *no diversity* in the memory as illustrated in the 2d classification example.\n\nThis means the points selected here have quite different characteristics compared to coreset points or the full dataset in general. Coreset points ideally can compactly represent the full dataset and can be used for inference in place of the full dataset.\n\nThat said, the contribution presented here is very useful. Just that I\u2019m not sure how well this will work in more challenging continual learning set-up where diversity is important for a long sequence of diverse tasks.\n\nb. The paper presents a post-hoc modification to approximate posterior (\u2018s mean and variance) to account for the decay in the likelihood contribution from past data. I wonder if this post-hoc adjustment is identical to running approximate inference with the adjusted likelihood?\n\nc. the adaptation parameters need to be tuned/known in advance, which seems to be a disadvantage of the current approach. Is the update presented here somewhat robust to mis-specification of these parameters? How would these be tuned in a more practical setting in which data arrive sequentially and we might not know the underlying \u201cconcept\u201d.\n\n6: Weak Accept", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

(Vasilescu & Terzopoulos, 2002), in their framework of TensorFaces, proposed to treat facial image data as multidimensional arrays and analyze them with tensor decompositions, which led to significant boost in face recognition accuracy. (Bailey & Aeron, 2017) employed higher-order co-occurence data and tensor factorization techniques to improve on word embeddings models. Tensor methods also allow to produce more accurate and robust recommender systems by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments (Frolov & Oseledets, 2017). In recent years a great deal of work was done in applications of tensor calculus to both theoretical and practical aspects of deep learning algorithms. (Lebedev et al., 2015) represented filters in a convolutional network with CP decomposition (Harshman, 1970; Carroll & Chang, 1970) which allowed for much faster inference at the cost of a negligible drop in performance. (Novikov et al., 2015) proposed to use Tensor Train (TT) decomposition (Oseledets, 2011) to compress fully\u2013connected layers of large neural networks while preserving their expressive power. Later on, TT was exploited to reduce the number of parameters and improve the performance of recurrent networks in long\u2013term forecasting (Yu et al., 2017) and video classification (Yang et al., 2017) problems. In addition to the practical benefits, tensor decompositions were used to analyze theoretical aspects of deep neural nets. (Cohen et al., 2016) investigated a connection between various network architectures and tensor decompositions, which made possible to compare their expressive power. Specifically, it was shown that CP and Hierarchial Tucker (Grasedyck, 2010) decompositions correspond to shallow networks and convolutional networks respectively. Recently, this analysis was extended by (Khrulkov et al., 2018) who showed that TT decomposition can be represented as a recurrent network with multiplicative connections. This specific form of RNNs was also empirically proved to provide a substantial performance boost over standard RNN models (Wu et al., 2016). First results on the connection between tensor decompositions and neural networks were obtained for rather simple architectures, however, later on, they were extended in order to analyze more practical deep neural nets. It was shown that theoretical results can be generalized to a large class of CNNs with ReLU nonlinearities (Cohen & Shashua, 2016) and dilated convolutions (Cohen et al., 2018), providing valuable insights on how they can be improved.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

For example, Feynman-Kac Formalism can be used to improve robustness (Wang et al., 2018). In this paper, we focus on the classification setting, where the goal is to provide guarantee of a constant prediction among a small region specified via some metric. The robustness certificate can be either exact or conservative, so long as a constant prediction is guaranteed in the certified region. Note that the certification of a completely black-box model requires checking the prediction values at every point around the point of interest, which is clearly infeasible. A practical certification algorithm inevitably has to specify and leverage the functional structure of the classifier in use to reduce the required computation. Exact certificates. The exact certificate of deep networks is typically derived for the networks with a piecewise linear activation function such as ReLU. Such networks have an equivalent mixed integer linear representation (Cheng et al., 2017; Lomuscio & Maganti, 2017; Dutta et al., 2017; Bunel et al., 2018). Hence, one may apply mixed integer linear programming to find the worst case adversary within any convex polyhedron such as an `1-ball or `\u221e-ball. Despite the elegant solution, the complexity is, in general, NP-hard and the algorithms are not scalable to large problems(Tjeng et al., 2017). Conservative certificates. A conservative certificate can be more scalable than the exact methods, since one can trade-off the accuracy of certification with efficiency (Gouk et al., 2018; Tsuzuku et al., 2018; Cisse et al., 2017; Anil et al., 2018; Hein & Andriushchenko, 2017). For example, one can relax the search of the worst case adversary as a simpler optimization problem that only bounds the effect of such adversary. Alternatively, people also consider the robustness problem in a modular way, where the robustness guarantee can be derived iteratively for each layer in the deep networks by considering the feasible values for each hidden layer (Gowal et al., 2018; Weng et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018; Mirman et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2018).", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Conventional regularization methods have rarely been applied in deep RL. One rare case of such use is in Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) (Lillicrap et al., 2016), where Batch Normalization is applied to all layers of the actor \u00b5 network and layers of the critic Q network prior to the action input, and L2 regularization is applied to the critic Q network because it tends to have overestimation bias (Fujimoto et al., 2018). Some recent studies have developed more complicated regularization approaches to continuous control tasks. Cheng et al. (2019) regularizes the stochastic action distribution \u03c0(a|s) using a suboptimal control prior. The regularization weight at a given state is adjusted based on the temporal difference (TD) error. The larger the TD error, the more the action distribution moves towards the prior. Galashov et al. (2019) introduces a default policy that receives limited information as a regularizer. The information asymmetry between the behavior policy and the default policy helps to accelerate convergence and improve performance. Parisi et al. (2019) introduces TD error regularization to penalize inaccurate value estimation and Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2016) regularization to penalize GAE variance. However, most of these regularizations are rather complicated (Galashov et al., 2019), specifically designed for certain algorithms (Parisi et al., 2019), or need prior information (Cheng et al., 2019).

One of the challenges of DRL is overfitting, which can occur when the ANN becomes too complex and starts to memorize the training data rather than generalizing to new situations. To address this issue, regularization techniques have been proposed, such as L1 and L2 regularization, weight clipping, batch normalization, and dropout. These techniques aim to prevent the ANN from becoming too complex and to encourage it to learn more generalizable representations of the environment.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of regularization methods for DRL, specifically focusing on policy optimization algorithms.

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been the dominant architecture for sequence modeling due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequences. However, RNNs suffer from several limitations, including the vanishing gradient problem and the difficulty of parallelizing the forward and backward passes.\n\nTo address these limitations, several recent works have proposed alternative architectures for sequence modeling. One such architecture is the Transformer, which was introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks. The Transformer is based on self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to weigh the importance of different positions in the input sequence when making predictions. This allows the model to capture long-term dependencies in the input sequence without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.\n\nAnother recent work that has shown promising results on sequence modeling is the Transformer-XL, which was introduced by Dai et al.

It employs a segment-level recurrence mechanism that allows the model to capture long-term dependencies in the input sequence while also allowing for parallelization of the forward and backward passes.\n\nIn addition to the Transformer and Transformer-XL, several other recent works have proposed alternative architectures for sequence modeling.

However, I have major concerns regarding the novelty this paper, the various claims it makes, as well as its experiment setting.\n\nMajor issues/questions:\n1. The techniques proposed by this paper lack novelty. For instance, the entire section 3.2 is simply the original design of the multi-head self-attention by Vaswani et al. The major difference between R-Transformer and the original Transformer is the replacement of positional embedding with an RNN layer, but (in my opinion) the authors did not demonstrate sufficiently its effectiveness via ablative studies (see below). Moreover, some prior works have already exploited the locality structure in Transformers. For instance, [1] showed that a sparse, local Transformer can work extremely well and be very efficient (they achieved SOTA on large-scale char-level language modeling tasks).\n\n2. The experiments do not entirely convince me. \n    i) The authors use the \"same hidden size for R-Transformer and Transformer.\" But in fact, as the R-Transformer has one extra RNN/LSTM/GRU layer at every level of the network, the tests were carried out (in effect) using a larger model than the baselines. I think the authors should instead control the # of model parameters, especially since you are running only on small tasks with small-sized models.\n    ii) It is nice that the authors tested R-Transformer on a variety of tasks--- this is important. However, in no way do these number achieve the levels of the \"state-of-the-art\", which the authors claim at the end of Section 1 (e.g., [2] has better number on seqMNIST and character-level PTB, and the Transformer-XL actually achieves <55 perplexity on word-level PTB). Therefore, the numbers don't look particularly appealing to me. \n    iii) Lack of more challenging, or large-scale experiments.\n    iv) Lack of ablative study. \n\n3. The authors claim that the finite-window RNN captures local features. But doesn't that claim only applies to the first layer? Once the first layer multi-head attention mixes all input elements across the sequence, the \"local\" features fed into the second layer RNN will be, actually, **global** features?

The problem of covariate shift was already observed, as the author notes: \u201cthe network must not solely be shown examples of accurate driving, but also how to recover once a mistake has been made\u201d. This issue was formalized in the work of (Ross & Bagnell, 2010), who on one hand proved an O( T 2) regret bound, and on the other hand provided an example showing this bound is tight. The subsequent work (Ross et al., 2011) proposed the DAGGER algorithm which obtains linear regret, provided the agent can both interact with the environment, and query the expert policy. Our approach also requires environment interaction, but importantly does not need to query the expert. note is the work of (Venkatraman et al., 2015), which extended DAGGER to time series prediction problems by using the true targets as expert corrections. Imitation learning has been used within the context of modern RL to help improve sample efficiency (Chang et al., 2015; Ross & Bagnell, 2014; Sun et al., 2017; Hester et al., 2018; Le et al., 2018; Cheng & Boots, 2018) or overcome exploration (Nair et al., 2017). These settings assume the reward is known and that the policies can then be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. In this case, covariate shift is less of an issue since it can be corrected using the reinforcement signal. The work of (Luo et al., 2019) also proposed a method to address the covariate shift problem when learning from demonstrations when the reward is known, by conservatively extrapolating the value function outside the training distribution using negative sampling. This addresses a different setting from ours, and requires generating plausible states which are off the manifold of training data, which may be challenging when the states are high dimensional such as images. The work of (Reddy et al., 2019) proposed to treat imitation learning within the Q-learning framework, setting a positive reward for all transitions inside the demonstration data and zero reward for all other transitions in the replay buffer.

More specifically, these ensemble policies are trained using BC loss. Under a limited amount of data (where BC fails), these policies would also fail and are inaccurate. Therefore, it should not be expected that a posterior from these inaccurate policies is accurate. Have the authors measure or analyze accuracy of these policies or that of the posterior? This important point is not mentioned or analyzed in the paper.\n\n- Alternative approaches to posterior approximation and uncertainty computation. \nThere are other approaches to obtain a posterior besides the ensemble approach, e.g., Bayesian neural networks. Such alternatives were not mentioned in the paper. Also, there are other quantities for measuring uncertainty besides the variance such as the entropy. These approaches and quantities have different pros and cons and they should be discussed in the paper.\n\n- Sample complexity in terms of environment interactions. \nThe sample complexity in terms of environment interactions is an important criterion for IL. I suggest the authors to include this criterion in the experiments. \n\n* Minor questions:\n- Why does the minibatch size is only 4 in the experiments for all methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for training deterministic NNs to not only estimate the desired target but also the associated evidence in support of that target. We accomplish this by placing evidential priors over our original Gaussian likelihood function and training our NN to infer the hyperparameters of our evidential distribution.

Thus the model estimates not only the probabilistic mean and variance of our target but also the underlying uncertainty associated with each of those parameters.

Our work builds on this foundation and presents a scalable representation for inferring the parameters of an evidential uncertainty distribution while simultaneously learning regression tasks via MLE. In Bayesian deep learning, priors are placed over network weights and estimated using variational inference (Kingma et al., 2015). Dropout (Gal & Ghahramani, 2016; Molchanov et al., 2017) and BBB (Blundell et al., 2015) rely on multiple samples to estimate predictive variance. Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017) provide a tangential approach where sampling occurs over multiple trained instances. In contrast, we place uncertainty priors over the likelihood function and thus only need a single forward pass to evaluate both prediction and uncertainty. Additionally, our approach of uncertainty estimation proved to be better calibrated and capable of predicting where the model fails. A large topic of research in Bayesian inference focuses on placing prior distributions over hierarchical models to estimate uncertainty (Gelman et al., 2006; 2008). Our methodology falls under the class of evidential deep learning which models higher-order distribution priors over neural network predictions to interpret uncertainty.

GuessWhat is one of the famous taskoriented dialog tasks, where the goal is to figure out a target object in the image through a dialog that the answerer has in mind (de Vries et al., 2017). However, GuessWhat is relatively an easy task because it only allows the answer form of yes or no. The baseline visual question answering (VQA) model achieves 78.5%. In the object guessing task (i.e., GuessWhat task itself), the state-of-the-art averaged accuracy of SL, RL (Zhang et al., 2018b), and AQM (Lee et al., 2018) reached 44.6% and 60.8%, and 72.9% at the 5th round, respectively. Random guessing baseline has an accuracy of\n16.0% (Han et al., 2017), thus RL algorithms achieve 53.3% error decrease, whereas AQM achieves 67.7%. GuessWhich is a cooperative two-player game that one player tries to figure out an image out of 9,628 that another has in mind (Das et al., 2017b). GuessWhich uses Visual Dialog dataset (Das et al., 2017a) which includes human dialogs on MSCOCO images (Lin et al., 2014) as well as the captions that are generated. Although GuessWhich is similar to GuessWhat, it is more challenging in every task including asking a question, giving an answer, and guessing the target class. For example, unlike GuessWhat that can be answered in yes or no, the answer can be an arbitrary sentence in GuessWhich. Therefore, the VQA task in the Visual Dialog dataset is much studied than the GuessWhat dataset (Lu et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2017b). Similar to GuessWhat, SL and RL approaches have been applied to solve the GuessWhich task and they showed a moderate increase in performance (Das et al., 2017b; Jain et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018a). However, based on the authors\u2019 recent Github implementation1 of the papers in ICCV (Das et al., 2017b), SL and RL methods have shown that only 6% of error is diminished through the dialog compared to the zeroth turn baselines which only use generated caption.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Specifically, the paper tries to circumvent the problem of explicitly calculating the information gain while asking a question in the AQM setting. While the original AQM approach sweeps over all possible guesses and answers while estimating information gain, this is rendered impractical in scenarios where this space cannot be tractably enumerated. As a solution, AQM+ proposes sweeping over only some top-k relevant instantiations of answers and guesses in this space by normalizing the probabilities of the subset of the space in consideration. \n\nComments:\n- The paper is overloaded with notations and the writing is not very smooth.

Specifically, SL approaches could either be trained discriminatively to rank options among the provided ones given dialog context or in a generative manner via token-level teacher forcing. The authors should clearly make this distinction in the introduction and in other places where it\u2019s needed.\n- The authors should stress more upon the approximations involved while calculating mutual information. As far as I understand, even in the AQM approach the numerator and the denominator within the logarithm are estimated from a different set of parameters and as such they need not be consistent with each other under marginalization. The term resembles MI and ensuring consistency in such a framework would require either of the numerator or the denominator to be close to something like a variational approximation of the true distribution. In addition, AQM+ adopts the same framework as AQM but computes MI over some top-k of the random variables being considered. Could the authors comment more on why restricting the space of r.v.\u2019s to some top-k samples is a good idea? Would that not lead to somewhat of a biased estimator?\n- Unless I am missing something, training aprxAgen from the training data (indA) seems odd. Assuming, this to be Qbot\u2019s mental model of Abot -- there is no prior reason why this should be initialized or trained in such a manner.

For instance, the observed reward channel is often subject to noise in practice (e.g., when observed rewards are collected through sensors), and thus observed rewards may not be credible. Also, in applications such as robotics, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm can be manipulated to produce arbitrary errors. In this paper, we consider noisy RL problems where observed rewards by RL agents are generated with a reward confusion matrix. We call such observed rewards as perturbed rewards. We develop an unbiased reward estimator aided robust RL framework that enables RL agents to learn in noisy environments while observing only perturbed rewards. Our framework draws upon approaches for supervised learning with noisy data. The core ideas of our solution include estimating a reward confusion matrix and defining a set of unbiased surrogate rewards. We prove the convergence and sample complexity of our approach. Extensive experiments on different DRL platforms show that policies based on our estimated surrogate reward can achieve higher expected rewards, and converge faster than existing baselines.

Recent studies (Huang et al., 2017; Kos & Song, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) show that learned RL policies can be easily misled with small perturbations in observations. The presence of noise is very common in real-world environments, especially in robotics-relevant applications. Consequently, robust (adversarial) reinforcement learning (RRL/RARL) algorithms have been widely studied, aiming to train a robust policy which is capable of withstanding perturbed observations (Teh et al., 2017; Pinto et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2018) or transferring to unseen environments (Rajeswaran et al., 2016; Fu et al., 2017). However, these robust RL algorithms mainly focus on noisy vision observations, instead of the observed rewards. A couple of recent works (Lim et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2017) have also looked into a rather parallel question of training robust RL algorithms with uncertainty in models. Learning with Noisy Data Learning appropriately with biased data has received quite a bit of attention in recent machine learning studies Natarajan et al. (2013); Scott et al. (2013); Scott (2015); Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014); van Rooyen & Williamson (2015); Menon et al. (2015). The idea of above line of works is to define unbiased surrogate loss function to recover the true loss using the knowledge of the noises. We adapt these approaches to reinforcement learning. Though intuitively the idea should apply in our RL settings, our work is the first one to formally establish this extension both theoretically and empirically. Our quantitative understandings will provide practical insights when implementing reinforcement learning algorithms in noisy environments.", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

Apart from the work cited by the paper (and perhaps work like Krueger et al. (2016), in which agents must pay some cost to observe true rewards), there is little work on learning settings of this kind. This paper represents a first step in gaining clarity on how to formalize and study this problem. I did, however, find the analysis and the experiments to be relatively disjointed -- the main sample complexity result presented by the paper (Theorem 2) was given for Phased Q-Learning, yet no experiments actually evaluate the performance of Phased Q-Learning. I think the paper could benefit from experiments focused on simple domains that showcase how traditional algorithms do in cases where it is easier to understand (and visualize) the impact of the reward perturbations (simple chain MDPs, grid worlds, etc.) -- and specifically experiments including Phased Q-Learning. \n\nSection 1) Introduction:\n\t- \"adversaries in real-world\" --> \"adversaries in the real-world\"\n\t- You might consider citing Loftin et al. (2014) regarding the bulleted point about \"Application-Specific Noise\".\n\t- \"unbiased reward estimator aided reward robust reinforcement learning framework\" --> this was a bit hard to parse. Consider making more concise, like: \"unbiased reward estimator for use in reinforcement learning with perturbed rewards\".\n\t- \"Our solution framework builds on existing reinforcement learning algorithms, including the recently developed DRL ones\" --> cite these up front So, cite: Q-Learning, CEM, SARSA, DQN, Dueling DQN, DDPG, NAF, and PPO, and spell out the acronym for each the first time you introduce them.\n\t- \"layer of explorations\" --> \"layer of exploration\"\n\nSection 2) Problem Formulation\n\t- \"as each shot of our\" --> what is 'shot' in this context?\n\t- \"In what follow,\" --> \"In what follows,\"\n\t- \"where 0 < \\gamma \\leq 1\" --> Usually, $\\gamma \\in [0,1)$, or $[0,1]$. Why can't $\\gamma = 0$?\n\t- The transition notation changes between $\\mathbb{P}_a(s_{t+1} | s_t)$ and $\\mathbb{P}(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t)$. I'd suggest picking one and sticking with it to improve clarity.\n\t- \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" --> Why is the Q-function just an example? Isn't is *the* state-action value function? That is, I'd suggest replacing \"to learn a state-action value function, for example the Q-function\" with \"to learn a state-action value function, also called the Q-function\"\n\t- \"Q-function calculates\" --> \"The Q-function denotes\"\n\t- \"the reward feedbacks perfectly\" --> \"the reward feedback perfectly\"\n\t- I prefer that the exposition of the perturbed reward MDP be done with C in the tuple. So: $\\tilde{M} = \\langle \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{R}, C, \\mathcal{P}, \\gamma \\rangle$. This seems the most appropriate definition, since the observed rewards will be generated by $C$.\n\t- The setup of the confusion matrix for reward noise over is very clean. It might be worth pointing out that $C$ need not be Markovian. There are cases where C is not just a function of $\\mathcal{S}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$, like the adversarial case you describe early on.\n\n\n4) Experiments:\n\t- Diverse experiments! That's great. Lots of algorithms, lots of environment types.\n\t- I expected to see Phrased Q-Learning in the experiments. Why was it not included?\n\t- The plots are pretty jagged, so I'm left feeling a bit skeptical about some of the results. The results would be strengthened if the experiments were repeated for more trials.\n\n6: Marginally above acceptance threshold", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

(2018) demonstrated that for several popular MRC datasets (e.g. SQuAD, TriviaQA) most questions can be answered using only a few sentences rather than the entire document. Motivated by this observation, they built a sentence selector to gather this potential evidence for use by the reader model. Nishida et al.

Open-domain QA, which involves answering questions without prior knowledge of the specific domain or context, is a challenging problem in NLP. In recent years, there has been significant progress in open-domain QA, with many approaches being proposed to address the challenges of this problem.\n\nOne approach to open-domain QA is to use a retrieval-reader model, which involves two main components: a retrieval component that retrieves relevant documents from a corpus, and a reader component that processes the retrieved documents to generate a response to the question. Retrieve-and-read models have been shown to be effective in open-domain QA, with many variants being proposed.\n\nOne such variant is the essential term-enhanced reader-retriever (ET-RR) model, which was proposed in a recent paper by Clark et al. (2018). The ET-RR model uses an essential term selector to identify the most important words in a question, which are then used to formulate more effective search queries when retrieving related evidence. The model also uses attention mechanisms to enhance the relevance of the retrieved documents to the question and to capture the relationships between the question, answer choices, and retrieved documents.\n\nAnother approach to open-domain QA is to use a multi-task learning framework, which involves training a single model to perform multiple related tasks simultaneously. For example, the multi-task learning framework proposed by Sewon et al. (2018) trains a model to perform both information retrieval and reading tasks, with the goal of improving the performance of both tasks.\n\nFinally, some approaches to open-domain QA use reinforcement learning techniques to improve the performance of the model.

The above two proposed modules (reader and selector) are not very novel, but are still valid contributions to me. Experiments on the ARC dataset shows that (1) the proposed reader itself improves over the state-of-the-art on the leaderboard; (2) introducing the essential term selector further improves the above results by about 2%.\n\nAlthough the paper also provides additional experiments on other datasets, I feel that the contributions of the proposed methods are not sufficiently verified. I would suggest the authors consider the following further experiments that I believe could improve its ratings:\n\n(1) The proposed reader works very well on ARC. However, besides the BiDAF, there is no comparison between the proposed reader and previous models on datasets other than ARC. In order to know whether the result generalizes or not, I think the authors should conduct experiments on the regular RACE or other multi-choice QA datasets, to fully test the reader model.\n\n(2) It is not clear whether the essential term selector could help on datasets other than science questions. Again, the authors reported results on two other datasets. However, on neither of these datasets the ET-RR was compared with ET-RR (Concat). Therefore, I have concerns that the proposed framework may only be significant on the ARC dataset.\n\nMoreover, it will be interesting to see whether the essential term selector can be learned from distant supervision.

Perhaps Goodfellow et al. (2014) is most similar to our work since we use the loss interpolation tool suggested in their paper to perform our analysis. They perform interpolation between the initial and final parameters and based on their finding, draw the conclusion that the loss along the line connecting these two points does not have any barriers. We note that we use their tool for a different purpose and our conclusions are fundamentally different from theirs because we use the observations to investigate whether SGD crosses barriers during optimization over deep networks\u2019 loss landscape. Li et al. (2017b) also visualize the loss landscape of different network architectures. Our work is closely related to a number of recent papers that study SGD as a diffusion process because we present a complementary qualitative view to an aspect of their theory. Hoffer et al. (2017) hypothesize this view based on the evidence that the parameter distance moved by SGD from initialization as a function of the number of iterations resembles a diffusion process. Li et al. (2017a) hypothesize this behavior of SGD and theoretically show that this diffusion process would allow SGD to escape sharp local minima. The authors use this theoretical result to support the findings of Keskar et al. (2016) who find that SGD with small mini-batch size find wider minima.

In this section, we review related work on the optimization of DNNs, focusing on the non-convex nature of the loss surface and the exploration of the loss landscape during training.\n\nGoodfellow et al. (2014) introduced the concept of the non-convex nature of the loss surface in DNNs, and how this affects the optimization process. They also proposed a method for visualizing the loss landscape of DNNs, which has been used in subsequent work.\n\nHoffer et al. (2017) studied the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the non-convex setting, and proposed a diffusion approximation framework to understand the optimization process. They also showed that larger batch sizes lead to slower exploration of the loss landscape.\n\nKeskar et al.

{"query": "Please write a review for this paper and you should provide some suggestions and raise some questions in your review.", "gt": "The subject of how a given algorithm explores the landscape is still a poorly understood area in training neural networks. There is a large body of recent work that attempts to shed light on this puzzle, and each one tries to claim their share in the furthering of the understanding of the relationship between the geometry of the landscape and the dynamics that one chooses in optimization. The present paper is a fine addition to the literature with interesting observations and novel questions, however, it falls short in many core areas: An apparent work in progress that has a great potential. \n\nA major question (that I hope will easily be addressed) is on the definition of the barrier itself. According to the text, a barrier is defined judging by the minima of two 1-dimensional segments that connect weights connecting three consecutive steps: if the minimum of the line segment defined by the latter step is larger than the former, then it declared that a barrier is crossed. In a low dimensional world, this makes total sense, however, I fail to understand what kind of barrier it implies on the geometry of the landscape: Can the 1-dimensional lines be on the sides of a valley? Can one find *another* 1-dimensional projection for which the inequality is broken? How do such dependencies change the understanding of the problem? And if one is indeed only interested in the flat line segments (since SGD is making discrete steps), then one can, in principle, observe barrier crossing in a convex problem, as well? Is there an argument for otherwise? Or if it is a notion that applies equally well in a convex case then how should we really think about the barrier crossing? On the opposite point of view, can one not imagine a barrier crossing that doesn't appear in this triangular inequality above?\n\nThe paper is full of empirical evidence that is guided by a simple observable that is very intuitive, however, it lacks a comprehensive discussion on the new quantity they propose that I consider a major flaw, but that I think (hope) that the authors can fix very easily. Some minor points that would improve the readability and clarity for the reader:\n- The figures are not very reader-friendly, this can be improved by better using the whitespaces in the paper but it can also be improved by finding further observables that would summarize the observations instead of showing individual consecutive line interpolations.\n- What are the values of the y-axis in Figure 5 and 6? Are they the top eigenvalues of the Hessian?\n- In the models that are compared in Figure 7, what are their generalization properties (early stopping and otherwise)?\n- The interpretation at the end of p. 6 may be a good motivation for the reader if it had been introduced earlier for that section.\n\n\n4: Ok but not good enough - rejection", "prompt": "[INST]Now you are given a very long document.

The authors use the diffusion perspective to analyze the behavior of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in DNNs and show that SGD rarely crosses barriers during training. Instead, they propose an alternate mechanism that SGD uses to explore different regions of the deep network loss landscape.\n\nThe authors first introduce the non-convexity of the deep neural network loss surface and show that the optimal solution in this setting is one that generalizes well rather than minimizing the loss. They then use the diffusion perspective to analyze the behavior of SGD in DNNs and show that SGD can be seen as a random walk on the loss surface.\n\nThe authors then present empirical evidence that supports their theoretical analysis. They show that the interpolation of SGD between parameters from consecutive updates is a quadratic-like structure and that SGD rarely crosses barriers during training. They also show that the minimum of each interpolation evolves as training progresses and that this minimum has ups and downs along the path of SGD for all their interpolation plots.\n\nThe authors then analyze the role of batch-size in exploration and show that mini-batch gradients from larger batch-sizes should align more with the high curvature directions of the loss surface, especially early on during training when the scale of mean gradients dominates over gradient covariance. They also show that the alignment of the mini-batch gradient with the sharp directions of the Hessian leads to oscillations preventing SGD from exploring regions far from the initialized parameters.\n\nThe paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the exploration process in DNNs and sheds light on the behavior of SGD in this setting. The authors' use of the diffusion perspective to analyze the behavior of SGD in DNNs is novel and provides a new way of understanding the exploration process. The empirical evidence presented in the paper supports the theoretical analysis and provides practical insights into the behavior of SGD in DNNs.\n\nOne suggestion for future work is to extend the analysis to other optimization algorithms, such as Adam or RMSprop, and compare their behavior to SGD. Another suggestion is to investigate the effect of regularization techniques, such as dropout or weight decay, on the exploration process in DNNs. Additionally", "evaluation": "rouge"}
