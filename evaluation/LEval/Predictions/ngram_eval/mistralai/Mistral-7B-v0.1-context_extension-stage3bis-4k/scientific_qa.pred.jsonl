It does not take into account the temporal order of tweets or the chunked timelines of tweets.\nBaseline 2: Top-$k$ replies, likes, or re-tweets: This baseline, as explained earlier, extracts the top $k$ replied, liked, or re-tweeted tweets from each account for detection of rumors. We also tested this approach on our dataset and found that $k=500$ for the top replied tweets yielded the highest result.\nTable TABREF25: shows the performance of the baselines compared to the neural network model that takes into account the temporal order of tweets and chunked timelines of tweets. The FacTweet model performs significantly better than the baselines on all performance metrics, particularly on macro F1 with an improvement of 1.73 over the top $k$ replies, likes, or re-tweets. This suggests that the temporal order of tweets and chunked timelines of tweets are important factors in predicting the factuality of Twitter news accounts. So, the results show that FacTweet significantly outperforms the other baselines, indicating that temporally-aware analysis of tweet streams is crucial in predicting the factuality of Twitter news accounts.

Introduction \nPeople are increasingly using social networking platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. to communicate their opinions and share information. Although the interactions among users on these platforms can lead to constructive conversations, they have been increasingly exploited for the propagation of abusive language and the organization of hate-based activities BIBREF0, BIBREF1, especially due to the mobility and anonymous environment of these online platforms. Violence attributed to online hate speech has increased worldwide. For example, in the UK, there has been a significant increase in hate speech towards the immigrant and Muslim communities following the UK's leaving the EU and the Manchester and London attacks. The US also has been a marked increase in hate speech and related crime following the Trump election. Therefore, governments and social network platforms confronting the trend must have tools to detect aggressive behavior in general, and hate speech in particular, as these forms of online aggression not only poison the social climate of the online communities that experience it, but can also provoke physical violence and serious harm BIBREF1.\nRecently, the problem of online abusive detection has attracted scientific attention. Proof of this is the creation of the third Workshop on Abusive Language Online or Kaggle\u2019s Toxic Comment Classification Challenge that gathered 4,551 teams in 2018 to detect different types of toxicities (threats, obscenity, etc.). In the scope of this work, we mainly focus on the term hate speech as abusive content in social media, since it can be considered a broad umbrella term for numerous kinds of insulting user-generated content. Hate speech detection is not a stable or simple target because misclassification of regular conversation as hate speech can severely affect users\u2019 freedom of expression and reputation, while misclassification of hateful conversations as unproblematic would maintain the status of online communities as unsafe environments BIBREF2.\nTo detect online hate speech, a large number of scientific studies have been dedicated by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in combination with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6, BIBREF7, BIBREF0.

Document is as follows.\nMethodology ::: Fine-Tuning Strategies\nIn the fine-tuning phase, the model is initialized with the pre-trained parameters and then are fine-tuned using the labelled datasets. Different fine-tuning approaches on the hate speech detection task are depicted in Figure FIGREF8, in which X_{i} is the vector representation of token i in a tweet sample, and are explained in more detail as follows:\n1. BERT based fine-tuning: In the first approach, which is shown in FIGREF8, very few changes are applied to the BERTbase. In this architecture, only the [CLS] token output provided by BERT is used. The [CLS] output, which is equivalent to the [CLS] token output of the 12th transformer encoder, a vector of size 768, is given as input to a fully connected network without hidden layer. The softmax activation function is applied to the hidden layer to classify.\n2. Insert nonlinear layers: Here, the first architecture is upgraded and an architecture with a more robust classifier is provided in which instead of using a fully connected network without hidden layer, a fully connected network with two hidden layers in size 768 is used. The first two layers use the Leaky Relu activation function with negative slope = 0.01, but the final layer, as the first architecture, uses softmax activation function as shown in FIGREF8.\n3. Insert Bi-LSTM layer: Unlike previous architectures that only use [CLS] as the input for the classifier, in this architecture all outputs of the latest transformer encoder are used in such a way that they are given as inputs to a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-LSTM) as shown in FIGREF8. After processing the input, the network sends the final hidden state to a fully connected network that performs classification using the softmax activation function.\n4. Insert CNN layer: In this architecture shown in FIGREF8, the outputs of all transformer encoders are used instead of using the output of the latest transformer encoder. So that the output vectors of each transformer encoder are concatenated, and a matrix is produced.

As another example, programmatic censorship on the Internet has spurred communities to adopt similar methods to communicate surreptitiously. [/ANS]  Instruction: Would you please create 10 examples under the provided title and instructions? [/INST]  Answer\n1. In this paper, we focus on adversarially-chosen spelling mistakes in the context of text classification, addressing the following attack types: dropping, adding, and swapping internal characters within words.\n\nThese perturbations are inspired by psycholinguistic studies which demonstrated that humans can comprehend text altered by jumbling internal characters, provided that the first and last characters of each word remain unperturbed.\n\n2. First, in experiments addressing both BiLSTM and fine-tuned BERT models, comprising four different input formats: word-only, char-only, word+char, and word-piece, we demonstrate that an adversary can degrade a classifier's performance to that achieved by random guessing. This requires altering just two characters per sentence. Such modifications might flip words either to a different word in the vocabulary or, more often, to the out-of-vocabulary token UNK. Consequently, adversarial edits can degrade a word-level model by transforming the informative words to UNK. Intuitively, one might suspect that word-piece and character-level models would be less susceptible to spelling attacks as they can make use of the residual word context. However, our experiments demonstrate that character and word-piece models are in fact more vulnerable. We show that this is due to the adversary's effective capacity for finer grained manipulations on these models. While against a word-level model, the adversary is mostly limited to UNK-ing words, against a word-piece or character-level model, each character-level add, drop, or swap produces a distinct input, providing the adversary with a greater set of options.\n\n3. Second, we evaluate first-line techniques including data augmentation and adversarial training, demonstrating that they", "evaluation": "f1"}

Similarly, we find that similarity- based approaches trained on the title text lead to better results concerning recommendation accuracy compared to approaches that use description text. Here, we propose to use the cross-source algorithm BIBREF13 to boost performance, but we find that using description text as source data for tag recommendations does not lead to better results. In contrast to approaches based on editor tags, these similarity-based approaches mainly recommend tags that are not directly related to the content of an e-book but reflect information that Amazon users search for (such as the e-book title) (see Figure FIGREF16 in Section SECREF7 ).\nFor Amazon, we find that both types of approaches perform poorly, no matter which textual content we choose in the cross-source algorithm BIBREF13 . We assume that the reason is that the Amazon search terms mainly represent a mixture of words from the e-book title. We believe that in real user settings, the e-books' content is much more important. Hence, approaches based on content information should perform better.\nHybrid approaches. The results of the similarity-based hybrid approaches based on the description text are on par with similarity-based approaches from the same source but are significantly outperformed by all of the hybrid approaches based on the title text. This might be because of the rich vocabulary we get from Amazon search terms. Furthermore, we can see that using author information helps to improve the overall performance of a similarity-based hybrid approach. This might be also because of the lack of unique identifiers that describe books of a specific author.\nInspection of top-5 predictions. To understand the recommendation quality of the tag recommendation approaches, we conducted an inspection of the top-5 predictions as well as a manual tag assignment by users (see Figure FIGREF15 in Section SECREF8 for the best results).

Consequently, using the popularity-based approaches (i.e., only based on the top 10 editor tags) we find recommendation diversity of INLINEFORM0 and semantic similarity of INLINEFORM1 among the algorithms (see Table TABREF3 ). Our results suggest that if we only consider most popular tags without contextual features, recommendation diversity of INLINEFORM2 and semantic similarity of INLINEFORM3 .\nSimilarity-based approaches. As for the popularity-based approaches, we find that the content of description text is more descriptive for the content of e-books than the title of the book. Thus, the similarity-based approach that only considers the description text (i.e., INLINEFORM0 ) performs better than the one that considers the title (i.e., INLINEFORM1 ).\nThe accuracy of these two (similarity-based) approaches is, in general, significantly lower than for popularity-based approaches. This observation is well-founded, as editors use a more descriptive and general tagging style (e.g., \u201cphilosophy\u201d or \u201ccrimefiction\u201d) than Amazon users, who search for the exact title of books (\u201cA tale of two cities\u201d). Thus, when exploiting e-book contents alone, we recommend tags that are semantically more similar to the content of the e-books (e.g., to recommend \u201ccrime fiction\u201d instead of \u201cA tale of two cities\u201d when dealing with the e-book of the latter title). Furthermore, the similarity between editor tags and users' vocabulary is limited as a consequence of the sparseness of the Amazon search term vocabulary. Hence, in case of popularity-based approaches we typically do not find any match even if tags are recommended for the e-book \"A tale of two cities\".\nNevertheless, we can observe for the content-based similarity approaches better accuracy than in the most popular approaches, which was based only on top- used tags. This indicates that the content is meaningful and useful for tag recommendations.

Each category contains a large number of training, development and testing posts. For comparison with the FBfans dataset, we extracted the development post on one of the topics from each category in CD. Since the proportion of development posts to training posts is approximately 25% in CD, this means that some development/testing posts may not appear in training (or may only appear in training), and authors, likers or commenters may appear in development/testing but not in training.

However, for user-generated posts on social media like Facebook or Twitter, there is more information that should not be ignored. On social media platforms, a user can act either as the author of a post or as a reader who expresses his or her comments about the post.\nIn this work, we classify posts taking into account post authorship, likes, topics, and comments. In particular, users and their \"likes\" hold strong potential for text mining. For example, given a set of posts that are related to a specific topic, a user's likes and dislikes provide clues for stance labeling. From a user point of view, users with positive attitudes toward the issue leave positive comments on the posts with praise or even just the post's content; from a post point of view, positive posts attract users who hold positive stances. We also investigate the influence of topics: different topics are associated with different stance labeling tendencies and word usage. For example, we discuss women's rights and unwanted babies on the topic of abortion, but we criticize medicine usage or crime when on the topic of marijuana BIBREF5. Even for posts on a specific topic like nuclear power, a variety of arguments are raised: green energy, radiation, air pollution, and so on.\nAs for comments, we treat them as additional text information. The arguments in the comments and the commenters (the users who leave the comments) provide hints on the post's content and further facilitate stance classification. \nExtra-Linguistic Features for Stance Classification\nIn this paper we aim to use text as well as other features to see how they complement each other in a deep learning model.

What are the similarities and differences between these systems?\n[/INST] Firstly, the Continental European Civil law is a system of law developed in Continental Europe, in contrast to the common law system that originated in England. It is based on the Roman legal traditions and has been widely adopted in Western Europe, as well as in many countries around the world. One of the key features of Continental European Civil Law is that it relies heavily on written codes and statutes, which are interpreted by the courts using principles of legal reasoning called jurisprudence. Secondly, Chinese Civil law also incorporates some elements of Continental European Civil law, such as the Code of Civil Procedure 1991, which regulates the legal procedures for all civil cases. However, Chinese Civil law also includes elements of common law, such as the emphasis on respecting personal and property rights. Finally, some basic similarities between these two systems include a focus on legal principles rather than precedent, a reliance on reason and logic rather than case-based interpretations, and a comprehensive coverage of civil law issues. [/INST] Ok great, this is definitely an interesting area of law. Any reason why the Continental European Civil Law was developed in Continental Europe?\n[/INST] There are a few reasons why the Continental European Civil Law was developed in Continental Europe. The first reason is that it has its roots in Roman law, which played a significant role in the legal traditions of Europe. Roman law was used", "evaluation": "f1"}

The total number of documents in our dataset is 21,724, consisting of 18,459 training documents, 1,000 validation documents, and 2,265 test documents.\nAll divorce judgments have three components: facts, pleas and results. Judgment results are binary. Facts are comprised of the descriptions of the petitioners and respondents such as personal facts, marital status, assets, and so on. In our dataset, there is no missing value in each component of the entire divorce judgments. Moreover, we also take law articles, namely civil laws and their interpretations, to enrich the information contained in the case documents. For each divorce document, we use the court of judgment and the date of judgment to look up related interpretations on civil laws. We choose 15 well-known interpretations that are closely related to divorces, such as that on custody of children and property division in divorces. Hereinafter, we use the term \u201cinterpretation\u201d interchangeably to refer to both the civil law and its corresponding interpretation.\nThe composition of our dataset shows that the main topics in divorce proceedings are as follows: 1. Seeking divorce and alimony; 2. Seeking compensation; 3. Asking for maintenance; 4. Determining custody of children; 5. Property division; 6. Restricting respondents to make use of petitioners' assets, and 7. Adopt a child. There are also cases with multiple pleas and some without any pleas.\nIn summary, there are four main types of legal documents in our dataset: 1. Interpretations; 2. Divorce judgments; 3.

Bilingual ST models are also included in Table TABREF22 and TABREF23. We can observe from the second columns that the model in the third column can also be used for bilingual ST.\nModel Training\nFor the training of our models, we use a data driven approach as described in berard2018end. In summary, we build a shared word vocabulary for all languages (transcript and translation side). The wordpiece tokens are then converted to learnable embeddings and fed to the attention network for subsequent operations.\nAt each wordpiece embedding layer, a dropout mask is sampled (uniform 0.1 keep probability) and then applied through a softmax to produce two learnable parameters: a scaling parameter and a weight parameter (used to calculate log probabilities). At each layer, the wordpiece embeddings are re-scaled with these parameters. This wordpiece-based approach ensures that the training process can selectively pay attention to regions of an embedding space that are used for a specific task's vocabulary.\nWe then use standard training and inference procedure for all our models as described in the previous sections and summarized in Table TABREF34.\nResults\nWe use CoVoST's development and test sets to evaluate our models as there is no other available set. Table TABREF45 shows the performance of our models on the development and test sets. While bilingual ST models achieve slightly better test performances, the difference is pretty small (bilingual ST is a special case of multilingual ST and they share the same model architecture).

The number of headings is an indicator of structure in an article. The number of images and the number of references typically indicate information that the paper provides, and how well cited it is. In this setting, we can observe that visual information alone provides no advantages over solely textual features. Note that when applying the visual model on a different Wikipedia sub-dataset, where only image information was available, it still performed better than the text model.\nWe see that our text and joint models outperform the simple textual features and visual model.

The other two subsets, although within the arXiv Computer Science category, each have their own challenges regarding quality assessment. CL articles tend to focus less on mathematics than AI, and therefore contain less visual complexity. LL articles, while more mathematics-heavy, tend to contain more complicated arguments, making textual quality assessment harder. However, this issue can be addressed in the future by investigating the suitability of different feature extraction techniques for the three CS subsets and by incorporating appropriate domain knowledge. This could be achieved, for example, via textual features such as a Word2vec BIBREF38 model trained on each domain or via visual techniques that detect mathematical formulas BIBREF39 .\nIn this paper, we exploited fine-grained label information available for the Wikipedia dataset (i.e., 6 classes).

Can we consider using ResNet or Xception instead?\nAnswer [7]\n[1] The three types of subject areas are cs.ai, cs.cl, and cs.lg.\n[2] We employ the Inception V3 model to create the visual representation of documents.\n[3] The input of the Inception V3 model that we use to create the visual representation is a visual rendering (screenshot) of a document, such as a Wikipedia article webpage.\n[4] We use a bidirectional long-short term memory (biLSTM) model to create the textual representation of documents.\n[5] The hyper-parameter setting of the Inception V3 model that we use to create the visual representation of documents is that it is pretrained on the ImageNet dataset.\n[6] The benefit of the proposed feed-forward layer and softmax in our model is that it enables us to combine the visual and textual embeddings, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of the quality of the documents.\n[7] Yes, you can consider using ResNet or Xception instead of Inception V3. For example, ResNet could potentially be more efficient in capturing features from the screenshot of the document. Xception could potentially provide a more accurate prediction, as it has a depth-wise separable convolution, which is more efficient in terms of computational complexity and parameter size. \n.", "evaluation": "f1"}

Introduction\nThe task of document quality assessment is to automatically assess a document according to some predefined inventory of quality labels. This can take many forms, including essay scoring (quality = language quality, coherence, and relevance to a topic), job application filtering (quality = suitability for role + visual/presentational quality of the application), or answer selection in community question answering (quality = actionability + relevance of the answer to the question). In the case of this paper, we focus on document quality assessment in two contexts: Wikipedia document quality classification, and whether a paper submitted to a conference was accepted or not.\nAutomatic quality assessment has obvious benefits in terms of time savings and tractability in contexts where the volume of documents is large. In the case of dynamic documents (possibly with multiple authors), such as in the case of Wikipedia, it is particularly pertinent, as any edit potentially has implications for the quality label of that document (and around 10 English Wikipedia documents are edited per second). Furthermore, when the quality assessment task is decentralized (as in the case of Wikipedia and academic paper assessment), quality criteria are often applied inconsistently by different people, where an automatic document quality assessment system could potentially reduce inconsistencies and enable immediate author feedback.\nCurrent studies on document quality assessment mainly focus on textual features. For example, BIBREF0 examine features such as the article length and the number of headings to predict the quality class of a Wikipedia article. In contrast to these studies, in this paper, we propose to combine text features with visual features, based on a visual rendering of the document. Figure 1 illustrates our intuition, relative to Wikipedia articles. Without being able to read the text, we can tell that the article in Figure 1 has higher quality than Figure 1 , as it has a detailed infobox, extensive references, and a variety of images. Based on this intuition, we aim to answer the following question: can we achieve better accuracy on document quality assessment by complementing textual features with visual features?\nOur visual model is based on fine-tuning an Inception V3 model BIBREF1 over visual renderings of documents, while our textual model is based on a hierarchical biLSTM. We further combine the two into a joint model. We perform experiments on two datasets: a Wikipedia dataset novel to this paper, and an arXiv dataset provided by", "evaluation": "f1"}

The best model was the BiGRU encoder trained on AL+CA+CO events. Its performance was almost identical to that of the supervised model trained on the whole ACP Corpus, suggesting that the proposed method is highly effective, though this time the training set consisted of only 54 thousand events. Table TABREF6 shows that the supervised model outperformed the (semi-)supervised one when the training set was relatively large (0.6 million events), but the situation is opposite when the training set consisted of only 6 thousand events. These results suggest that the supervised model may require a large amount of training data to be effective.\nThe second part of the question's answer could be: The hyperparameters for the BiGRU encoder were finally determined as follows:\nFor the experiments, we trained the model using the Adam BIBREF19 optimizer. We set the initial learning rate to $0.001$ and the dropout rate to $0.1$. We set the batch size to $64$, and the model parameters were tuned so that the total number of parameters was $< 113,264$.

The images were obtained by gathering tweets containing images from a combination of Twitter searches involving hate or offensive words. The dataset specifically focuses on identifying hate speech within multimodal tweets, so it is specifically designed to include both text-exclusive and image-exclusive tweets, among others. 5. I'm curious to know if there are any specific", "evaluation": "f1"}

The models proposed by Gao et al. and Margffoy-Tuay et al. learn convolution kernels from the textual information to merge visual and textual information in an early model stage. This approach addresses the limitations of the former models, but we improve the feature fusion process by learning to convolve the image features with the question-guided kernels in an instance segmentation scenario.\n", "evaluation": "f1"}
