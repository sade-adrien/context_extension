Herbert Samuel was the first British High Commissioner in Mandatory Palestine.  Leopold Greenberg was a prominent American Zionist leader and activist, known for his work in the Zionist movement and his contributions to American Zionism.  The Six Day War was a six-day military conflict between Israel and the neighboring Arab countries Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, which took place between June 5-10, 1967. The war resulted in a decisive victory for Israel, who managed to capture the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula.  Theodor Herzl was the founder of modern Zionism, and he was passionate in his desire to create a Jewish state in Palestine. This drove him to write the pamphlet \"The Jewish State\" with the intention of presenting practical proposals for a lasting Jewish homeland.  The International Zionist Organization, or IZO, was an umbrella organization of Zionist groups across the world that was established in 1897 by Theodor Herzl as a means of promoting the establishment of a Jewish nation-state in Palestine. It existed until 1948, when it merged with the World Jewish Congress.  The Second World Conference of the Union of Zionist Revisionist Organizations was an international Zionist conference that brought together different groups and organizations to advocate for the Revisionist Zionist movement, which sought to promote the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. This conference took place in 1936.  David Ben-Gurion was one of the most important leaders of the Zionist movement and the state of Israel. He served as the first Prime Minister of Israel and as Minister of Defense, and is largely responsible for the founding of the State of Israel.
