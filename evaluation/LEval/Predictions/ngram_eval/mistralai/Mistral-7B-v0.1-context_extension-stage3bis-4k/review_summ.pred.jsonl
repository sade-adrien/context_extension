Anything we needed the staff would immediately accommodate us & they also had great suggestions on where to go for entertainment, etc. The food in the restaurant was incredible, the chocolate torte was most delectable and the waiter, Martine, never rushed us, even after the restaurant was closed; although, the maitre de was not so friendly, he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there. The rooms were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom. My room had a balcony & living room which was great since we were traveling with friends; when they came over we could \"entertain\" in our suite. I loved the location because we were a step a way from everything...we did so much walking. The jazz festival was 5 blocks north, the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few blocks away. I had a great time & would definitely stay there again. Review #1:My stay at this hotel was simply wonderful. I loved the decor of the lobby and the friendly service upon checking in. The hotel was very clean and we ended up getting a free upgrade to a suite. The rooms were very comfortable and modern-looking. (Although it was quite cozy for us, with a rambunctious toddler and a baby.) The suite layout was perfect for our family of four and we had a wonderful time. Not only the rooms, but also the whole hotel was very quiet, which was appreciated!  The complimentary Internet service and nightly bottled water service were nice touches.  I had a great time and would stay there again. Review #2:My boyfriend and I stayed here on the final leg of a NYC to Montreal road trip and there was no better place to round off the holiday. This is a very late review and is coming on the heels of some terrible service at another hotel. This bad experience had me thinking jeez, these guys need to learn a little customer service from... and Woila...Le Saint Sulpice popped in my mind. I", "evaluation": "rouge"}
