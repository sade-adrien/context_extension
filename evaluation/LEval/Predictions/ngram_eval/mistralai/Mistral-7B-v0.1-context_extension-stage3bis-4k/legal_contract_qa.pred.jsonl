The agreement outlines that NCM owns and operates a \"Digital Content Network\" of proprietary and third-party hardware and software pursuant to which the Service may be digitally transmitted to equipment and facilities installed in, and displayed on movie screens, video display terminals and similar equipment located in, movie theaters or other high traffic retail establishments, as further described herein.2. The agreement specifies that Network Affiliate is to purchase the small d Equipment, but the cost will be entirely borne by NCM and the type of equipment and technology for such connectivity shall be at NCM's discretion. This suggests that Network Affiliate will not have any ownership stake in the small d Equipment and is simply a recipient of the services provided by NCM.3. The agreement also outlines that Network Affiliate may at any time in its sole and absolute discretion, convert any of the Theatres so that Digital Cinema Services can be provided, using technology commonly known Big D technology. Network Affiliate will purchase or lease and will install such Big D Equipment in the Network Affiliate Theatres, and shall bear the entire cost of such Equipment. This suggests that Network Affiliate will have some ownership stake in the Big D Equipment, but it remains unclear how much of the total ownership is attributable to each party.4.
