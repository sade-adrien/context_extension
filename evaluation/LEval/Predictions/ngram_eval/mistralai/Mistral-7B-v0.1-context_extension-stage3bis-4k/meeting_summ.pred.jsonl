However, the Trudeau government delayed in implementing such measures, leading many to question why the government responded so late compared to some of its international counterparts. The Conservative Party, in particular, accused the government of mishandling the situation and not taking the virus seriously enough. At an O'Toole government rally on April 30, 2021, Erin O'Toole, the leader of the Conservative Party, criticized Trudeau's decision to call for a general election during the height of the pandemic and argued that the delay in implementing strong public health policy allowed the virus to gain traction across the country. In response, Trudeau defended his government's response, emphasizing the extensive consultations his team conducted with scientific and health experts before enacting a comprehensive response. As the pandemic continued, many experts and citizens praised the government's response in the second wave, which was notably more agile and strategic than the first. The government's response includes widespread testing, extensive contact tracing, and targeted lockdowns in areas with high infection rates.

The PDG is intended to provide targeted support to students who are experiencing poverty, and children who have a free school meal (FSM) are often impacted by the negative effects of poverty on their education. The PDG provides students with the support and resources they need to attend school regularly and engage in learning, which can lead to better attendance rates overall.\nEstyn, the National Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales, regularly inspects Welsh schools and examines the use of PDG in schools as part of their inspections. Evidence suggests that the PDG is making a positive difference in many schools, with some schools reporting improved attendance rates among FSM students. Estyn found that PDG was being used to provide students with support to attend school and access additional resources such as transportation, uniform, and educational trips, which can improve engagement in learning. However, Estyn also found that some schools were struggling to make effective use of the PDG due to a lack of adequate financial management systems and a lack of awareness of evidence-based interventions to improve attendance and engagement.\nIn my opinion, there needs to be a sustained effort to ensure that all schools are effectively using the PDG to support students. This involves developing effective financial management systems, monitoring the impact of PDG on attendance and engagement regularly, and providing training and support to teachers to help them identify and support students who may be struggling with attendance or engagement.

These difficulties can lead to behavioral and attendance issues in schools, prompting more frequent disciplinary action and exclusions.\nAnother factor could be the lack of consistent support systems in place for these vulnerable learners. In some cases, looked-after children may not have a consistent adult figure in their lives to support them and advocate for their needs, which can make it more difficult to engage with school life.

It was a \u00a335 million investment, over three years, for 300 schools. The intention was to change teacher, leader and school practices by having a very specific focus on the key areas that we identified as problematic in terms of raising attainment and achievement, using evidence-based interventions. So the three strands, as you are aware, were literacy and numeracy, additional learning needs, and improving pupils' behaviour,\u00a0and it is certainly true to say that we wanted to change the mindset within schools and I think that challenge within schools themselves, and I think there was undoubtedly\u00a0positive change in terms of some schools coming together, working in shared inset days or looking at some issues together. Obviously, if you look at those issues in isolation, they may not have had an immediate impact. If we look in terms of behaviour, then, it wasn't surprising that actually that took more immediate work. If we look at literacy and numeracy then, that's where the impact certainly wasn't seen in terms of achievement in the KS2 or SAT results. But in\u00a0our impact assessment for 2017 to 2020\u2014it was actually published last summer\u2014we identified that the three-year impact of Schools Challenge Cymru was actually to change leadership practice, change teaching practice\u00a0and change classroom practice, change attitudes and change beliefs. And I think the key lessons that we would continue to see and have taken forward are that it is vital that we bring that evidence-based knowledge in terms of what we know works into schools so that they understand it and can use it. I think it's perhaps more important to have the understanding of the evidence of what works\u00a0than to push and be prescriptive in terms of how to use those evidenced-based interventions in the classrooms, and we are very careful, going forward with our work and our policies,\u00a0not to be prescriptive around the actual interventions.

So, for instance, the regional consortia have come back and have indicated to me already, for instance, that there's a greater need for support for special schools, but they need to be able to develop the offer in conjunction with the local authority and the independent schools.
