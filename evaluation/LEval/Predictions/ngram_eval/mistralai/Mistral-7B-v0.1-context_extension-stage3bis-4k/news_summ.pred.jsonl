We now know Microsoft's answer: The computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve Microsoft's margins on Windows phones, which will allow it to invest more in the platform, which will accelerate sales and market share growth, the Washington Post reports. But John Herrman at Buzzfeed has another explanation: \"Fear of dying alone.\" Here's what he and other pundits are saying: The presentation \"manages to sound both insane and uninspiring, outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic,\" Herman argues\u2014like capturing a whole 15% of the smartphone market. \"It's a fitting end for the close of Microsoft's Ballmer era, during which the company \u2026 missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades\" while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways. Like everyone, Microsoft is trying to ape the Apple model, MobileOpportunity observes. But it's not so sure that's a good idea. \"There already is an apple,\" the blog points out, and other software/hardware hybrid companies, like Palm and BlackBerry, have been crushed under its heel. Maybe Microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its OS. The move risks complicating Microsoft's crucial relationships with other PC and device manufacturers, one analyst tells ZDNet. But he adds that \"Microsoft needed to make a bold move\" or face \"certain terminal decline,\" and that the price it paid for Nokia \"seems extremely reasonable.\" Meanwhile, Matthew Yglesias at Slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from Nokia CEO (and, perhaps, Microsoft heir apparent) Stephen Elop, in which he uses the story of a Deepwater Horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform\u2014a seemingly desperate, yet necessary move\u2014to explain the company's shift from its own failed OS to Windows Phone.

The summary should include the following points:\n1. The acquisition represents a strategy by Microsoft to build a devices and services company away from its traditional services business model.\n2. Nokia's decision to partner with Microsoft in 2011 came after Apple and Android had taken the smartphone market shares away from Nokia, and Nokia's phone business struggled.\n3. Microsoft's business market is a target, and Nokia's Asha devices could work as on-ramps for consumers' early smartphones.\n4. The acquisition allows Microsoft to have deeper integration, the benefit of Nokia's patents, and removes the risk of Nokia going Android or being acquired by someone else.\n5. Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia faces several challenges, including the integration of Nokia's business model and balancing the demands of Microsoft's competitors in emerging markets.\n6. The acquisition, despite the long journey ahead, is a necessary move for Microsoft to regain a firm foothold in the market. \nHere is the requested output:\nIn summary, Microsoft's acquisition of Nokia's cell phone business is a long journey ahead aimed at building a devices and services strategy by purchasing Nokia's patent portfolio, including deep integration of Nokia's business model and the removal of the risk of Nokia going Android or being acquired by someone else.

The Supreme Court punted on her case in 2013, and now it's back on the docket. Like the unions case, this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs.

To avoid financial ruin, fraternities have merged into \"vast national organizations\" that buy liability insurance, and they've created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow\u2014so when the inevitable lawsuits come, frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules.
