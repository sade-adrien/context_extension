Then, voice-over starts narrating his life.\nIn a series of montages, Owen is shown doing things like running, working, dancing with a woman, fighting for his life, getting married, and being kissed. These segments represent different parts of Owen's life and show the events that he has been through while being brought back from the dead.\nIn the next scene, Owen opens the refrigerator to find out that he can no longer drink alcohol. This contrasts with the flashback scenes where he was shown drinking and enjoying it.\nJack, Toshiko, and Gwen are in the hub working and discussing aliens and weddings. Owen shows up with his gun pointing at them and says he is a dead idiot. He then asks why he would be a threat to the team. Jack says that three days ago, Owen died. However, Owen is fine and does not believe Jack is being sincere.\nMartha Jones replaces Owen as Torchwood's new medical officer, and she works out a series of tests and examinations that she wants to perform on him. Owen is angry about this, but Jack says that it is important for them to make sure he is still mentally fit for duty. Ianto takes Owen's gun and security pass and Owen gives Martha's test a try.\nHowever, when Owen tries to make coffee, he struggles with the coffee machine and causes it to malfunction. Owen complains that he is losing to Ianto, who has a better life than him and is always going on missions, and has a boyfriend. He says he is stuck making coffee and that his colleagues are getting married and having significant others while he has none.\nMartha scans Owen and finds there is no decay in his muscles.
