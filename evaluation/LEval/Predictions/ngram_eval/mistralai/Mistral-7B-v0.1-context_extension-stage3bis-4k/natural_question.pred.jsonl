Bartholdi traveled to New York to investigate possible locations, and settled on Bedloe's -- later Liberty -- Island in New York Harbor, to commemorate the nation's centennial. The New York Chamber of Commerce also contributed money , and the people of France raised more money by selling replicas of the statue and coins from a special mintage of 5-cent coins. Construction started in 1876, using the funds that had been raised by the Franco-American Union. During a stopover at Madison Square Park in Manhattan, the completed arm and torch were exhibited. On July 4, 1876, the centennial of American independence, Laboulaye lit the statue 's torch to celebrate American liberty. By 1884, the head and torso of the statue were completed, and a team of 214 men completed it. On June 17, 1885, the statue was unveiled in a ceremony in Paris that lasted five days in front of dignitaries, journalists, and visitors from all over the world. In 1885, the American fundraising effort for the project proved stalled because of economic problems.

[/INST] As an AI, I do not have personal opinions or preferences, so it is difficult to determine if there is an ancient statue that was a direct inspiration for the Statue of Liberty's torch, as I do not have access to contextual information outside of what is provided in this explanation. However, I can provide general information about the inspiration behind the Statue of Liberty, as stated in this source:\nThe Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City. The statue was designed by French sculptor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The torch-bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882. \nThe torch , which is held high above Libertas ' left hand , was designed to symbolize the enlightenment that Bartholdi believed would spread throughout the world as a result of the principles of the French Revolution. The sculptor was inspired by the ancient Greek statue of Nike of Samothrace , now held in the Louvre Museum in Paris . The design for the Statue of Liberty was unveiled at a fundraising fair in Paris in 1876 , where Bartholdi presented the design models and drawings of his ideas to prospective donors . The exhibition was so successful that it helped raise enough money for Bartholdi to create two small replicas of the statue . These replicas were displayed at the Paris World\u2019s Fair later that year . One of the smaller copies , the Bartholdi Pedestal Model , is currently on display at the Legacy Museum in New Orleans . [/INST] Based on the above, it is highly likely that the torch on the Statue of Liberty is inspired by the ancient Greek statue of Nike of Samothrace.

The courts are then given the authority to review laws passed by the Parliament or the provincial legislative assemblies and strike down parts that contradict the Charter rights . The judiciary also has the power to exclude evidence in trials, which comes from any source that violates the human rights of a person . However , the judiciary is under the instruction that it should attempt to preserve a balance between the protection of society by the laws , and the upholding of human rights of those being tried . </P> <P> As with any Canadian federal law , the Charter comes into direct competition with those laws created by the provinces . However , the Charter does not apply to the territories directly . </P> <P> The Charter does not explicitly give any power to Canadians to use in public petitions to the courts . According to sections 32.1 of the Charter , a person can petition the courts in the event where the Charter is being contravened and courts in turn decide if they have the jurisdiction to act if the dispute has arisen out of legislation . In the event the person , who has petitioned against the state , wins the case , section 32.1 of the Charter allows the courts to award any remedies they deem fit . The remedy that the courts normally award the petitioners of the Charter is a nominal financial amount of $1 . The nominal amount may be symbolic or may even serve to pay off legal expenses the petitioner incurred , but is often given so that a plaintiff has formally been `` awarded '' something and the legal case has not been futile . Some legal cases have ended with orders to pay $1 by the defendant . Section 32.1 also limits some aspects of the enforcement of the Charter , such that a Charter petitioner cannot be awarded a financial amount greater than $1 ,000 , unless the court finds that the violation of the Charter by the government was willful or has caused the petitioner harm . </P> <P> The Charter is also not limited to the exercise of rights by adults .

This means they cannot be violated except under circumstances enumerated in the provisions on exceptions . Most rights in the Charter do not allow violations without justification . For example , before people can be arrested or jailed , evidence must be presented first before an independent judicial officer and must satisfy the threshold of `` probable cause '' . These rights and freedoms are enforceable , although other legal limitations might remain . On some issues ( for example , discrimination or sexual assault ) the issue was never resolved when the Act came into force . Judicial interpretations on these provisions are thus unknown . Thus , the Charter guarantees `` broad rights ''. </P> <P> The Charter is not justiciable in Quebec because of section 33 ( the notwithstanding clause ) of the Charter . This section permits parliament and legislatures to exempt all of the Charter or some of its provisions from judicial review , by way of a formal vote . An exemption from judicial review lasts up to five years . There are many legal restrictions to the use of the notwithstanding clause , mainly designed to ensure it is used carefully . These restrictions are outlined in the legislation that enacted the clause, the Canada Act 1982 . </P> <P> Some parts of the Charter are called `` remedial '' or `` protective '' . Courts are more likely to strike down inoperative laws or regulations and award remedies ( such as the remedy for damages ) to individuals who have suffered under laws passed by provincial or federal legislatures because the courts treat the rights in those sections as `` more deserving '' or `` more important '' . Other parts of the Charter carry no remedy with them and those rights are called `` negative rights '' . </P> <P> </P> <P> One of the most important new powers the courts have gained is the power to declare laws inoperative when they conflict with the Charter through section 52 of the Constitution Act , 1982 .
