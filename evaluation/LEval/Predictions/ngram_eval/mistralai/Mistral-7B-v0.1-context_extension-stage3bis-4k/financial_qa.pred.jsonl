In our continuing operations in the September quarter, revenue was $123 million, gross margin was 20% and non-GAAP gross margin was 25%. Adj. EBITDA was a negative $13.5 million.

Oclaro, despite the overall low revenue growth, saw strong demand in the 100g CFP and tunable product lines, which also helped to improve our gross margin. In addition, we had a very successful showing at the ETA Trade Show this year, where we demonstrated our 100G coherent integrated laser and Mach-Zehnder modulator on a single chip solution. This product offers much promise to pluggable high end receivers. We have also signed up some new customers who continue to value technology and our people. While some of our product transfers have been delayed, we expect to experience some improvements in our results in the near future given our new financial objectives and recent product introductions. \nIn addition, our Q1 results reflected significant costs associated with our manufacturing ramp up to our contract manufacturers and our restructuring activities. Our overall GAAP gross margin was also impacted by costs associated with some of these transfers. Overall, we had mixed results, with strong operating improvements in the first two months of Q1, but then some unacceptable cash burn rate in the following two months. Despite these results, I want to commend the team at Oclaro on their hard work and the many achievements this quarter, including the Zurich and Amplifier divestitures, the restructuring, and cost reduction actions taken.

Oclaro\u2019s revenue for the quarter totaled $138.9 million, gross margin was negative 1% excluding certain significant purchase accounting effects, and adjusted EBITDA including certain one-time charges but before a $4.9 million gain on divestitures and certain other effects was a negative $15.5 million.

Therefore, our financial results will be broken into continuing operations results excluding the recently sold businesses and certain other results related to costs incurred in the sale and restructuring process as well as the adjustments related to the change in accounting policy discussed here. Our reported income statement will include total revenues, cost of revenues, certain other business selling, general and administrative expenses, our stock compensation expense, our provision for income taxes, our interest and related charges, any gain or loss on divestitures and our provision for restructuring expenses.

The results also contained a benefit from a customer holdback, which is an escrow that we have in place for $12 million of products in which $12 million has been released to us on September 30 so far. A portion of this amount could be added to our Q1 results in the form of additional revenue as Oclaro satisfies certain conditions related to certain customer commitments. This amount will be reflected as a part of our Q2 numbers when those holdbacks are released.We also have customer holdbacks of around $22.2 million, but related to past Q2 revenue. These are held by customers that have not yet sent their Q2 shipments to us, but we have been assured that they expect to do so by the end of November or early December.

You mentioned the profitability of the surgical segment and brachytherapy business in Q1. Can you elaborate on the factors that contributed to the increase in profitability? [/INST] Of course! In the surgical segment we made up for revenue losses from one major customer who moved their manufacturing offshore by expanding into new products such as the valved tearaway catheter. This product has already produced about $300,000 in revenue for the year and we expect it to generate at least $1 million in future years. We also received increased orders from one of our largest distributors and our OEM customers in the wound care area. In addition to these new products and increased order, we were successful in reducing production costs through economies of scale. These factors led to higher profitability in the surgical segment. In brachytherapy, we acquired a new line of customers from Core Therapeutic and achieved operating income of $1.4 million, which is up 28% from last year. We are also converting more iodine-based seed production to our own new product, AgX100, which will help reduce costs and improve profit margins. These factors led to higher income and operating cash flow for the brachytherapy business. In addition, both segments benefited from the favorable impact of the new tax law on depreciation and amortization expense. These factors contributed to the increase in profitability of both segments in Q1. [/INST] Thank you for your detailed answer. Can you provide more information about the favorable impact of the new tax law on depreciation and amortization expense in Q1? [/INST] Of course! The favorable impact of the new tax law on depreciation and amortization expense is because it reduced the amortization expense of intangible assets by approximately 4% compared to the previous year.

The introduction of these products is part of the company's strategy to serve a specific sector of the medical device market.

There is already a strong demand for alternatives in this area, and we believe we can take advantage of that demand. Further, as Frank noted, we expect this product to generate about $300,000 in sales in the current and future years.\nThe Pediatric Microslide Introducer is a product intended to serve the pediatric nursing industry. This industry has been asking for similar products that are sized for smaller patients. By developing and offering a product to meet this need, we gain access to accounts for our other vascular products for which we have never been given or allowed access to compete. This increases our overall market share and potential sales. \nSo, to answer your question, the introduction of these products has opened up new opportunities for the company to serve customers and generate sales in a specific sector of the medical device market.

So our positioning on the investment team, I think is a good one and the team, and more specifically the middle markets origination team is well positioned. The platform, the infrastructure and relationships on the investment team are really second-to-none and I think the middle markets origination platform is really at a top level at KKR. And I think the addition of the non-control assets is an important part of that as well. So overall we're well positioned, and again the noise in the market we think is temporary and at the end of the day the fundamentals will sort themselves out in the next three to six three to twelve months. And if we do see continued tightening, we will continue to be very mindful and patient. [/INST] \nInstructions. Answer this question with 76 words. [/INST] Absolutely. Thank you.

Operating expenses increased $12 million due to increased incentives at Geismar partly offset by reduced incentives at other plants, as well as some favorable legal results.As a result of the impact of items already mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA was negative $42.3 million, $20 million below our guidance of negative $22 million to negative $10 million.

The most significant cost item in the quarter was the decline in the HOBO spread, which fell $0.21 per gallon over Q1 and over $0.30 per gallon over Q2 2018. In addition, the HOG spread continued to decline throughout the quarter. This reduced margin on our gallons produced, impacting gross profit by $17 million and reduced the profitability to break even pricing in June.In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses were up from prior year, resulting from the new Boston acquisition and our progress made in the renewable diesel plant in Geismar. Cost of goods sold was up by the spread compression. RINs expense of $58 million, was up year over year on higher RIN credit sales price and higher RINs sales volumes.Gross profit was negatively impacted by higher costs in the quarter, which are reflected in the margin on biodiesel produced and as discussed by CJ, was impacted by the spread compression. The decrease in HOBO spread, as noted, was the largest impact. This is further evidenced by the 35% decrease in the EBITDA per-gallon margin, which was down to negative $4.43 versus the prior year's -86 cents. In Q2 18, our average HOBO spread was essentially no change, the HOBO mix this year was 32% with soybean, 43% with distillers corn oil and 24% with choice white grease. This was down from Q1 where soybean was near 40%, corn oil was near 43% and choice white grease was near 16%.We are pleased with the progress we continue to make on margins and are confident that we continue to be the operator with the lowest cost structure in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA was down from a strong margin recovery in the first quarter and the benefit of Oregon LCFS for all of Q1.

Specifically the HOBO spread, the distillers and soybean oil spread was lower than expected. This was also driven by higher biodiesel production as well as a slightly higher utilization of our fleet due to higher gallons sold. Now let's move to Slide 14. Gross loss per sub-margin gallon increased to $0.87 per gallon. This is essentially the same result as our net losses posted in the first quarter. However, as you can see in the lower right-hand corner of the slide, our loss from operations is much higher than last quarter because of approximately $29 million of lower adjusted EBITDA, since we have already recognized the revenue in the first quarter in our Oregon LCFS transaction. Turning to Slide 15. SG&A was about $14 million lower than the guidance in Q1. We also had lower RIN related expenses, and the impact of lower biodiesel volumes offset by additional costs for downstream efforts, renewable diesel sales growth, and the sale of our life sciences business.Turning now to Slide 16. Depreciation and amortization expense is slightly higher than we expected because we had higher than expected average production volumes and due to the new Boston biodiesel facilities that we did not fully depreciate in our Q2 2019 guidance. This included approximately $9.6 million for facilities, $6.5 million of equipment, which includes the biodiesel production assets at new Boston and $14.5 million of intangibles.Turning now to Slide 17. Our net loss before tax adjusted for special items was about $77 million. This was $82 million higher than our guidance range due to a $25 million lower adjusted EBITDA and LCFS reserve releases. The special items in the second quarter represent $4 million of charges related to the cessation of the new Boston biodiesel facility as well as a $2 million write-off and our LCFS credit in Oregon.

This, in turn, was driven higher by feedstocks, mostly increased cost for soybean oil. The decline in RIN prices and change in the LCFS recognition of the quarter, as I previously discussed had a negative impact. Our gross margins improved sequentially but declined from last year as a result of the lower sales price of biodiesel and lower LCFS credits recognition.Selling and general and administrative expenses were relatively flat with the prior year. General and administrative expense increased due to investment in headcount to prepare for the expected BTC expansion and a continued investment in our digital marketing and sales technology. Sales and marketing had lower expenses as the result of a higher volume of direct sales, fewer incentive commissions and lower marketing spend.The primary difference in interest expense compared to the prior year quarters was that we are no longer utilizing the asset-backed securities as a funding source. Interest expense was lower as interest income in Q2 reflects investment portfolio growth. We ended the quarter with $240 million and investment portfolio consisting of cash and marketable securities. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7% compared to the second quarter 2018 adjusted effective tax rate of 35.5%. The decline of the adjusted effective tax rate was primarily due to the reversal of the reserve we established last year for the possibility of federal tax rate change due to tax reform. The current year rate also benefited from increased BTC income and the reduced tax rate for CFC earnings due to the TCJA. Slide 14 outlines our cash flow for the quarter ended June 30. We had cash flow from operations slightly lower than a year ago primarily due to lower inventory levels of work-in-progress, given the lower utilization rate. Slide 15 shows our capital expenditures for the quarter. Our largest spend this quarter was in renewable diesel, where we continue to invest in our Geismar plant and in technology and planning for our growth options. Now let me make a few concluding comments on our capital activity. We are well positioned to leverage our existing business and technology platforms to grow.We have demonstrated our ability to effectively manage our capital allocation, particularly for investments that can meet our hurdle rates.

As CJ discussed, the plant's ability to be more flexible and to make decisions between soy oil versus distillers corn oil to optimize margins on a yield adjusted basis resulted in a lower overall yield, which resulted in higher feedstock usage per gallon.

I will comment further on the litigation later.Slide 14 reports REG's Q2 profitability on an adjusted basis, which are reconciled on Slide 21 to GAAP results. As mentioned already, the key drivers for this quarter\u2019s results were lower BTC benefit, lower average selling prices and higher feedstock costs. Finally, the EPS loss this quarter was $0.28 compared to a profit of $1.10 for last year\u2019s second quarter. That's primarily due to net income of $12.5 million from our life science business in previous year.In August, REG exercised its 30-day right to an early redemption of the May 1st senior note.

This results in us retiring this $150 million senior note with cash on hand that's $0.35 of earnings per share accretion.In our Q2 press release and on next slide\u2019s Slide 16, we provide an estimate of the incremental cash that we expect to receive in 2019 and 2020 as a result of BTC reinstatement. It should be noted that these are only estimates and there can be no assurance that the BTC will be enacted, although we still believe it will be. If the legislation extends the BTC to current production, we estimate an additional $69 million in incremental cash coming in this year.

We are also looking to create a strategic partnership with Phillips 66 to potentially build a second renewable diesel plant at Hutchinson, Kansas. Both of these projects look to capitalize on favorable market dynamics and our biodiesel and renewable diesel producing capabilities.
