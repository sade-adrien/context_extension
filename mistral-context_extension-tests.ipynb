      "you have no reason to dislike me, you allow, yourself. Dear uncle! send\n",
      "me a kind note to-morrow, and leave to join you anywhere you please,\n",
      "except at Thrushcross Grange. I believe an interview would convince you\n",
      "that my father’s character is not mine: he affirms I am more your\n",
      "nephew than his son; and though I have faults which render me unworthy\n",
      "of Catherine, she has excused them, and for her sake, you should also.\n",
      "You inquire after my health—it is better; but while I remain cut off\n",

      "perhaps, they might meet: meantime, he wished him to continue writing\n",
      "at intervals, and engaged to give him what advice and comfort he was\n",
      "able by letter; being well aware of his hard position in his family.\n",
      "Linton complied; and had he been unrestrained, would probably have\n",
      "spoiled all by filling his epistles with complaints and lamentations:\n",
      "but his father kept a sharp watch over him; and, of course, insisted on\n",
      "every line that my master sent being shown; so, instead of penning his\n",

      "together about once a week, under my guardianship, and on the moors\n",
      "nearest the Grange: for June found him still declining. Though he had\n",
      "set aside yearly a portion of his income for my young lady’s fortune,\n",
      "he had a natural desire that she might retain—or at least return in a\n",
      "short time to—the house of her ancestors; and he considered her only\n",
      "prospect of doing that was by a union with his heir; he had no idea\n",
      "that the latter was failing almost as fast as himself; nor had any one,\n",
      "I believe: no doctor visited the Heights, and no one saw Master\n",
      "Heathcliff to make report of his condition among us. I, for my part,\n",
      "began to fancy my forebodings were false, and that he must be actually\n",
      "rallying, when he mentioned riding and walking on the moors, and seemed\n",
      "so earnest in pursuing his object. I could not picture a father\n",
      "treating a dying child as tyrannically and wickedly as I afterwards\n",
      "learned Heathcliff had treated him, to compel this apparent eagerness:\n",

      "sunshine, but with a sky too dappled and hazy to threaten rain: and our\n",
      "place of meeting had been fixed at the guide-stone, by the cross-roads.\n",
      "On arriving there, however, a little herd-boy, despatched as a\n",

      "But when we reached him, and that was scarcely a quarter of a mile from\n",
      "his own door, we found he had no horse; and we were forced to dismount,\n",
      "and leave ours to graze. He lay on the heath, awaiting our approach,\n",
      "and did not rise till we came within a few yards. Then he walked so\n",

      "Catherine surveyed him with grief and astonishment: she changed the\n",
      "ejaculation of joy on her lips to one of alarm; and the congratulation\n",
      "on their long-postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were\n",
      "worse than usual?\n",
      "\n",
      "“No—better—better!” he panted, trembling, and retaining her hand as if\n",
      "he needed its support, while his large blue eyes wandered timidly over\n",
      "her; the hollowness round them transforming to haggard wildness the\n",
      "languid expression they once possessed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But you have been worse,” persisted his cousin; “worse than when I saw\n",
      "you last; you are thinner, and—”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m tired,” he interrupted, hurriedly. “It is too hot for walking, let\n",
      "us rest here. And, in the morning, I often feel sick—papa says I grow\n",
      "so fast.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Badly satisfied, Cathy sat down, and he reclined beside her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is something like your paradise,” said she, making an effort at\n",
      "cheerfulness. “You recollect the two days we agreed to spend in the\n",
      "place and way each thought pleasantest? This is nearly yours, only\n",
      "there are clouds; but then they are so soft and mellow: it is nicer\n",
      "than sunshine. Next week, if you can, we’ll ride down to the Grange\n",
      "Park, and try mine.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton did not appear to remember what she talked of; and he had\n",
      "evidently great difficulty in sustaining any kind of conversation. His\n",
      "lack of interest in the subjects she started, and his equal incapacity\n",
      "to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not\n",
      "conceal her disappointment. An indefinite alteration had come over his\n",
      "whole person and manner. The pettishness that might be caressed into\n",
      "fondness, had yielded to a listless apathy; there was less of the\n",
      "peevish temper of a child which frets and teases on purpose to be\n",
      "soothed, and more of the self-absorbed moroseness of a confirmed\n",
      "invalid, repelling consolation, and ready to regard the good-humoured\n",
      "mirth of others as an insult. Catherine perceived, as well as I did,\n",
      "that he held it rather a punishment, than a gratification, to endure\n",
      "our company; and she made no scruple of proposing, presently, to\n",
      "depart. That proposal, unexpectedly, roused Linton from his lethargy,\n",
      "and threw him into a strange state of agitation. He glanced fearfully\n",
      "towards the Heights, begging she would remain another half-hour, at\n",
      "least.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I think,” said Cathy, “you’d be more comfortable at home than\n",
      "sitting here; and I cannot amuse you to-day, I see, by my tales, and\n",
      "songs, and chatter: you have grown wiser than I, in these six months;\n",
      "you have little taste for my diversions now: or else, if I could amuse\n",
      "you, I’d willingly stay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay to rest yourself,” he replied. “And, Catherine, don’t think or\n",
      "say that I’m _very_ unwell: it is the heavy weather and heat that make\n",
      "me dull; and I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me. Tell\n",
      "uncle I’m in tolerable health, will you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll tell him that _you_ say so, Linton. I couldn’t affirm that you\n",
      "are,” observed my young lady, wondering at his pertinacious assertion\n",
      "of what was evidently an untruth.\n",
      "\n",
      "“And be here again next Thursday,” continued he, shunning her puzzled\n",
      "gaze. “And give him my thanks for permitting you to come—my best\n",
      "thanks, Catherine. And—and, if you _did_ meet my father, and he asked\n",
      "you about me, don’t lead him to suppose that I’ve been extremely silent\n",
      "and stupid: don’t look sad and downcast, as you _are_ doing—he’ll be\n",
      "angry.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I care nothing for his anger,” exclaimed Cathy, imagining she would be\n",
      "its object.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But I do,” said her cousin, shuddering. “_Don’t_ provoke him against\n",
      "me, Catherine, for he is very hard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is he severe to you, Master Heathcliff?” I inquired. “Has he grown\n",
      "weary of indulgence, and passed from passive to active hatred?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton looked at me, but did not answer; and, after keeping her seat by\n",
      "his side another ten minutes, during which his head fell drowsily on\n",
      "his breast, and he uttered nothing except suppressed moans of\n",
      "exhaustion or pain, Cathy began to seek solace in looking for\n",
      "bilberries, and sharing the produce of her researches with me: she did\n",
      "not offer them to him, for she saw further notice would only weary and\n",
      "annoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it half-an-hour now, Ellen?” she whispered in my ear, at last. “I\n",
      "can’t tell why we should stay. He’s asleep, and papa will be wanting us\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, we must not leave him asleep,” I answered; “wait till he wakes,\n",
      "and be patient. You were mighty eager to set off, but your longing to\n",
      "see poor Linton has soon evaporated!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why did _he_ wish to see me?” returned Catherine. “In his crossest\n",
      "humours, formerly, I liked him better than I do in his present curious\n",
      "mood. It’s just as if it were a task he was compelled to perform—this\n",
      "interview—for fear his father should scold him. But I’m hardly going to\n",
      "come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure; whatever reason he may have for\n",
      "ordering Linton to undergo this penance. And, though I’m glad he’s\n",
      "better in health, I’m sorry he’s so much less pleasant, and so much\n",
      "less affectionate to me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You think _he is_ better in health, then?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” she answered; “because he always made such a great deal of his\n",
      "sufferings, you know. He is not tolerably well, as he told me to tell\n",
      "papa; but he’s better, very likely.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There you differ with me, Miss Cathy,” I remarked; “I should\n",
      "conjecture him to be far worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton here started from his slumber in bewildered terror, and asked if\n",
      "any one had called his name.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” said Catherine; “unless in dreams. I cannot conceive how you\n",
      "manage to doze out of doors, in the morning.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought I heard my father,” he gasped, glancing up to the frowning\n",
      "nab above us. “You are sure nobody spoke?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Quite sure,” replied his cousin. “Only Ellen and I were disputing\n",
      "concerning your health. Are you truly stronger, Linton, than when we\n",
      "separated in winter? If you be, I’m certain one thing is not\n",
      "stronger—your regard for me: speak,—are you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The tears gushed from Linton’s eyes as he answered, “Yes, yes, I am!”\n",
      "And, still under the spell of the imaginary voice, his gaze wandered up\n",
      "and down to detect its owner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy rose. “For to-day we must part,” she said. “And I won’t conceal\n",
      "that I have been sadly disappointed with our meeting; though I’ll\n",
      "mention it to nobody but you: not that I stand in awe of Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Hush,” murmured Linton; “for God’s sake, hush! He’s coming.” And he\n",
      "clung to Catherine’s arm, striving to detain her; but at that\n",
      "announcement she hastily disengaged herself, and whistled to Minny, who\n",
      "obeyed her like a dog.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll be here next Thursday,” she cried, springing to the saddle.\n",
      "“Good-bye. Quick, Ellen!”\n",
      "\n",
      "And so we left him, scarcely conscious of our departure, so absorbed\n",
      "was he in anticipating his father’s approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before we reached home, Catherine’s displeasure softened into a\n",
      "perplexed sensation of pity and regret, largely blended with vague,\n",
      "uneasy doubts about Linton’s actual circumstances, physical and social:\n",
      "in which I partook, though I counselled her not to say much; for a\n",
      "second journey would make us better judges. My master requested an\n",
      "account of our ongoings. His nephew’s offering of thanks was duly\n",
      "delivered, Miss Cathy gently touching on the rest: I also threw little\n",
      "light on his inquiries, for I hardly knew what to hide and what to\n",
      "reveal.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven days glided away, every one marking its course by the henceforth\n",
      "rapid alteration of Edgar Linton’s state. The havoc that months had\n",
      "previously wrought was now emulated by the inroads of hours. Catherine\n",
      "we would fain have deluded yet; but her own quick spirit refused to\n",
      "delude her: it divined in secret, and brooded on the dreadful\n",
      "probability, gradually ripening into certainty. She had not the heart\n",
      "to mention her ride, when Thursday came round; I mentioned it for her,\n",
      "and obtained permission to order her out of doors: for the library,\n",
      "where her father stopped a short time daily—the brief period he could\n",
      "bear to sit up—and his chamber, had become her whole world. She grudged\n",
      "each moment that did not find her bending over his pillow, or seated by\n",
      "his side. Her countenance grew wan with watching and sorrow, and my\n",
      "master gladly dismissed her to what he flattered himself would be a\n",
      "happy change of scene and society; drawing comfort from the hope that\n",
      "she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had a fixed idea, I guessed by several observations he let fall,\n",
      "that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in\n",
      "mind; for Linton’s letters bore few or no indications of his defective\n",
      "character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from\n",
      "correcting the error; asking myself what good there would be in\n",
      "disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power\n",
      "nor opportunity to turn to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "We deferred our excursion till the afternoon; a golden afternoon of\n",
      "August: every breath from the hills so full of life, that it seemed\n",
      "whoever respired it, though dying, might revive. Catherine’s face was\n",
      "just like the landscape—shadows and sunshine flitting over it in rapid\n",
      "succession; but the shadows rested longer, and the sunshine was more\n",
      "transient; and her poor little heart reproached itself for even that\n",
      "passing forgetfulness of its cares.\n",
      "\n",
      "We discerned Linton watching at the same spot he had selected before.\n",
      "My young mistress alighted, and told me that, as she was resolved to\n",
      "stay a very little while, I had better hold the pony and remain on\n",
      "horseback; but I dissented: I wouldn’t risk losing sight of the charge\n",
      "committed to me a minute; so we climbed the slope of heath together.\n",
      "Master Heathcliff received us with greater animation on this occasion:\n",
      "not the animation of high spirits though, nor yet of joy; it looked\n",
      "more like fear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is late!” he said, speaking short and with difficulty. “Is not your\n",
      "father very ill? I thought you wouldn’t come.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“_Why_ won’t you be candid?” cried Catherine, swallowing her greeting.\n",
      "“Why cannot you say at once you don’t want me? It is strange, Linton,\n",
      "that for the second time you have brought me here on purpose,\n",
      "apparently to distress us both, and for no reason besides!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton shivered, and glanced at her, half supplicating, half ashamed;\n",
      "but his cousin’s patience was not sufficient to endure this enigmatical\n",
      "behaviour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“My father _is_ very ill,” she said; “and why am I called from his\n",
      "bedside? Why didn’t you send to absolve me from my promise, when you\n",
      "wished I wouldn’t keep it? Come! I desire an explanation: playing and\n",
      "trifling are completely banished out of my mind; and I can’t dance\n",
      "attendance on your affectations now!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“My affectations!” he murmured; “what are they? For heaven’s sake,\n",
      "Catherine, don’t look so angry! Despise me as much as you please; I am\n",
      "a worthless, cowardly wretch: I can’t be scorned enough; but I’m too\n",
      "mean for your anger. Hate my father, and spare me for contempt.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Nonsense!” cried Catherine in a passion. “Foolish, silly boy! And\n",
      "there! he trembles, as if I were really going to touch him! You needn’t\n",
      "bespeak contempt, Linton: anybody will have it spontaneously at your\n",
      "service. Get off! I shall return home: it is folly dragging you from\n",
      "the hearth-stone, and pretending—what do we pretend? Let go my frock!\n",
      "If I pitied you for crying and looking so very frightened, you should\n",
      "spurn such pity. Ellen, tell him how disgraceful this conduct is. Rise,\n",
      "and don’t degrade yourself into an abject reptile—_don’t_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With streaming face and an expression of agony, Linton had thrown his\n",
      "nerveless frame along the ground: he seemed convulsed with exquisite\n",
      "terror.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” he sobbed, “I cannot bear it! Catherine, Catherine, I’m a\n",
      "traitor, too, and I dare not tell you! But leave me, and I shall be\n",
      "killed! _Dear_ Catherine, my life is in your hands: and you have said\n",
      "you loved me, and if you did, it wouldn’t harm you. You’ll not go,\n",
      "then? kind, sweet, good Catherine! And perhaps you _will_ consent—and\n",
      "he’ll let me die with you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "My young lady, on witnessing his intense anguish, stooped to raise him.\n",
      "The old feeling of indulgent tenderness overcame her vexation, and she\n",
      "grew thoroughly moved and alarmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consent to what?” she asked. “To stay! tell me the meaning of this\n",
      "strange talk, and I will. You contradict your own words, and distract\n",
      "me! Be calm and frank, and confess at once all that weighs on your\n",
      "heart. You wouldn’t injure me, Linton, would you? You wouldn’t let any\n",
      "enemy hurt me, if you could prevent it? I’ll believe you are a coward,\n",
      "for yourself, but not a cowardly betrayer of your best friend.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“But my father threatened me,” gasped the boy, clasping his attenuated\n",
      "fingers, “and I dread him—I dread him! I _dare_ not tell!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, well!” said Catherine, with scornful compassion, “keep your\n",
      "secret: _I’m_ no coward. Save yourself: I’m not afraid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her magnanimity provoked his tears: he wept wildly, kissing her\n",
      "supporting hands, and yet could not summon courage to speak out. I was\n",
      "cogitating what the mystery might be, and determined Catherine should\n",
      "never suffer to benefit him or any one else, by my good will; when,\n",
      "hearing a rustle among the ling, I looked up and saw Mr. Heathcliff\n",
      "almost close upon us, descending the Heights. He didn’t cast a glance\n",
      "towards my companions, though they were sufficiently near for Linton’s\n",
      "sobs to be audible; but hailing me in the almost hearty tone he assumed\n",
      "to none besides, and the sincerity of which I couldn’t avoid doubting,\n",
      "he said—\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is something to see you so near to my house, Nelly. How are you at\n",
      "the Grange? Let us hear. The rumour goes,” he added, in a lower tone,\n",
      "“that Edgar Linton is on his death-bed: perhaps they exaggerate his\n",
      "illness?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No; my master is dying,” I replied: “it is true enough. A sad thing it\n",
      "will be for us all, but a blessing for him!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“How long will he last, do you think?” he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t know,” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Because,” he continued, looking at the two young people, who were\n",
      "fixed under his eye—Linton appeared as if he could not venture to stir\n",
      "or raise his head, and Catherine could not move, on his\n",
      "account—“because that lad yonder seems determined to beat me; and I’d\n",
      "thank his uncle to be quick, and go before him! Hallo! has the whelp\n",
      "been playing that game long? I _did_ give him some lessons about\n",
      "snivelling. Is he pretty lively with Miss Linton generally?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Lively? no—he has shown the greatest distress,” I answered. “To see\n",
      "him, I should say, that instead of rambling with his sweetheart on the\n",
      "hills, he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“He shall be, in a day or two,” muttered Heathcliff. “But first—get up,\n",
      "Linton! Get up!” he shouted. “Don’t grovel on the ground there: up,\n",
      "this moment!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Linton had sunk prostrate again in another paroxysm of helpless fear,\n",
      "caused by his father’s glance towards him, I suppose: there was nothing\n",
      "else to produce such humiliation. He made several efforts to obey, but\n",
      "his little strength was annihilated for the time, and he fell back\n",
      "again with a moan. Mr. Heathcliff advanced, and lifted him to lean\n",
      "against a ridge of turf.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now,” said he, with curbed ferocity, “I’m getting angry—and if you\n",
      "don’t command that paltry spirit of yours—_damn_ you! get up directly!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will, father,” he panted. “Only, let me alone, or I shall faint.\n",
      "I’ve done as you wished, I’m sure. Catherine will tell you that I—that\n",
      "I—have been cheerful. Ah! keep by me, Catherine; give me your hand.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take mine,” said his father; “stand on your feet. There now—she’ll\n",
      "lend you her arm: that’s right, look at _her_. You would imagine I was\n",
      "the devil himself, Miss Linton, to excite such horror. Be so kind as to\n",
      "walk home with him, will you? He shudders if I touch him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Linton dear!” whispered Catherine, “I can’t go to Wuthering Heights:\n",
      "papa has forbidden me. He’ll not harm you: why are you so afraid?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can never re-enter that house,” he answered. “I’m _not_ to re-enter\n",
      "it without you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop!” cried his father. “We’ll respect Catherine’s filial scruples.\n",
      "Nelly, take him in, and I’ll follow your advice concerning the doctor,\n",
      "without delay.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’ll do well,” replied I. “But I must remain with my mistress: to\n",
      "mind your son is not my business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are very stiff,” said Heathcliff, “I know that: but you’ll force\n",
      "me to pinch the baby and make it scream before it moves your charity.\n",
      "Come, then, my hero. Are you willing to return, escorted by me?”\n",
      "\n",
      "He approached once more, and made as if he would seize the fragile\n",
      "being; but, shrinking back, Linton clung to his cousin, and implored\n",
      "her to accompany him, with a frantic importunity that admitted no\n",
      "denial. However I disapproved, I couldn’t hinder her: indeed, how could\n",
      "she have refused him herself? What was filling him with dread we had no\n",
      "means of discerning; but there he was, powerless under its gripe, and\n",
      "any addition seemed capable of shocking him into idiocy. We reached the\n",
      "threshold; Catherine walked in, and I stood waiting till she had\n",
      "conducted the invalid to a chair, expecting her out immediately; when\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff, pushing me forward, exclaimed—“My house is not stricken\n",
      "with the plague, Nelly; and I have a mind to be hospitable to-day: sit\n",
      "down, and allow me to shut the door.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shut and locked it also. I started.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall have tea before you go home,” he added. “I am by myself.\n",
      "Hareton is gone with some cattle to the Lees, and Zillah and Joseph are\n",
      "off on a journey of pleasure; and, though I’m used to being alone, I’d\n",
      "rather have some interesting company, if I can get it. Miss Linton,\n",
      "take your seat by _him_. I give you what I have: the present is hardly\n",
      "worth accepting; but I have nothing else to offer. It is Linton, I\n",
      "mean. How she does stare! It’s odd what a savage feeling I have to\n",
      "anything that seems afraid of me! Had I been born where laws are less\n",
      "strict and tastes less dainty, I should treat myself to a slow\n",
      "vivisection of those two, as an evening’s amusement.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He drew in his breath, struck the table, and swore to himself, “By\n",
      "hell! I hate them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I am not afraid of you!” exclaimed Catherine, who could not hear the\n",
      "latter part of his speech. She stepped close up; her black eyes\n",
      "flashing with passion and resolution. “Give me that key: I will have\n",
      "it!” she said. “I wouldn’t eat or drink here, if I were starving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff had the key in his hand that remained on the table. He\n",
      "looked up, seized with a sort of surprise at her boldness; or,\n",
      "possibly, reminded, by her voice and glance, of the person from whom\n",
      "she inherited it. She snatched at the instrument, and half succeeded in\n",
      "getting it out of his loosened fingers: but her action recalled him to\n",
      "the present; he recovered it speedily.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Catherine Linton,” he said, “stand off, or I shall knock you\n",
      "down; and that will make Mrs. Dean mad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of this warning, she captured his closed hand and its\n",
      "contents again. “We _will_ go!” she repeated, exerting her utmost\n",
      "efforts to cause the iron muscles to relax; and finding that her nails\n",
      "made no impression, she applied her teeth pretty sharply. Heathcliff\n",
      "glanced at me a glance that kept me from interfering a moment.\n",
      "Catherine was too intent on his fingers to notice his face. He opened\n",
      "them suddenly, and resigned the object of dispute; but, ere she had\n",
      "well secured it, he seized her with the liberated hand, and, pulling\n",
      "her on his knee, administered with the other a shower of terrific slaps\n",
      "on both sides of the head, each sufficient to have fulfilled his\n",
      "threat, had she been able to fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this diabolical violence I rushed on him furiously. “You villain!” I\n",
      "began to cry, “you villain!” A touch on the chest silenced me: I am\n",
      "stout, and soon put out of breath; and, what with that and the rage, I\n",
      "staggered dizzily back, and felt ready to suffocate, or to burst a\n",
      "blood-vessel. The scene was over in two minutes; Catherine, released,\n",
      "put her two hands to her temples, and looked just as if she were not\n",
      "sure whether her ears were off or on. She trembled like a reed, poor\n",
      "thing, and leant against the table perfectly bewildered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know how to chastise children, you see,” said the scoundrel, grimly,\n",
      "as he stooped to repossess himself of the key, which had dropped to the\n",
      "floor. “Go to Linton now, as I told you; and cry at your ease! I shall\n",
      "be your father, to-morrow—all the father you’ll have in a few days—and\n",
      "you shall have plenty of that. You can bear plenty; you’re no weakling:\n",
      "you shall have a daily taste, if I catch such a devil of a temper in\n",
      "your eyes again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cathy ran to me instead of Linton, and knelt down and put her burning\n",
      "cheek on my lap, weeping aloud. Her cousin had shrunk into a corner of\n",
      "the settle, as quiet as a mouse, congratulating himself, I dare say,\n",
      "that the correction had alighted on another than him. Mr. Heathcliff,\n",
      "perceiving us all confounded, rose, and expeditiously made the tea\n",
      "himself. The cups and saucers were laid ready. He poured it out, and\n",
      "handed me a cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Wash away your spleen,” he said. “And help your own naughty pet and\n",
      "mine. It is not poisoned, though I prepared it. I’m going out to seek\n",
      "your horses.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first thought, on his departure, was to force an exit somewhere. We\n",
      "tried the kitchen door, but that was fastened outside: we looked at the\n",
      "windows—they were too narrow for even Cathy’s little figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Master Linton,” I cried, seeing we were regularly imprisoned, “you\n",
      "know what your diabolical father is after, and you shall tell us, or\n",
      "I’ll box your ears, as he has done your cousin’s.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, Linton, you must tell,” said Catherine. “It was for your sake I\n",
      "came; and it will be wickedly ungrateful if you refuse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Give me some tea, I’m thirsty, and then I’ll tell you,” he answered.\n",
      "“Mrs. Dean, go away. I don’t like you standing over me. Now, Catherine,\n",
      "you are letting your tears fall into my cup. I won’t drink that. Give\n",
      "me another.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine pushed another to him, and wiped her face. I felt disgusted\n",
      "at the little wretch’s composure, since he was no longer in terror for\n",
      "himself. The anguish he had exhibited on the moor subsided as soon as\n",
      "ever he entered Wuthering Heights; so I guessed he had been menaced\n",
      "with an awful visitation of wrath if he failed in decoying us there;\n",
      "and, that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa wants us to be married,” he continued, after sipping some of the\n",
      "liquid. “And he knows your papa wouldn’t let us marry now; and he’s\n",
      "afraid of my dying if we wait; so we are to be married in the morning,\n",
      "and you are to stay here all night; and, if you do as he wishes, you\n",
      "shall return home next day, and take me with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Take you with her, pitiful changeling!” I exclaimed. “_You_ marry?\n",
      "Why, the man is mad! or he thinks us fools, every one. And do you\n",
      "imagine that beautiful young lady, that healthy, hearty girl, will tie\n",
      "herself to a little perishing monkey like you? Are you cherishing the\n",
      "notion that _anybody_, let alone Miss Catherine Linton, would have you\n",
      "for a husband? You want whipping for bringing us in here at all, with\n",
      "your dastardly puling tricks: and—don’t look so silly, now! I’ve a very\n",
      "good mind to shake you severely, for your contemptible treachery, and\n",
      "your imbecile conceit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I did give him a slight shaking; but it brought on the cough, and he\n",
      "took to his ordinary resource of moaning and weeping, and Catherine\n",
      "rebuked me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stay all night? No,” she said, looking slowly round. “Ellen, I’ll burn\n",
      "that door down but I’ll get out.”\n",
      "\n",
      "And she would have commenced the execution of her threat directly, but\n",
      "Linton was up in alarm for his dear self again. He clasped her in his\n",
      "two feeble arms sobbing:—“Won’t you have me, and save me? not let me\n",
      "come to the Grange? Oh, darling Catherine! you mustn’t go and leave,\n",
      "after all. You _must_ obey my father—you _must_!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I must obey my own,” she replied, “and relieve him from this cruel\n",
      "suspense. The whole night! What would he think? He’ll be distressed\n",
      "already. I’ll either break or burn a way out of the house. Be quiet!\n",
      "You’re in no danger; but if you hinder me—Linton, I love papa better\n",
      "than you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The mortal terror he felt of Mr. Heathcliff’s anger restored to the boy\n",
      "his coward’s eloquence. Catherine was near distraught: still, she\n",
      "persisted that she must go home, and tried entreaty in her turn,\n",
      "persuading him to subdue his selfish agony. While they were thus\n",
      "occupied, our jailor re-entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your beasts have trotted off,” he said, “and—now Linton! snivelling\n",
      "again? What has she been doing to you? Come, come—have done, and get to\n",
      "bed. In a month or two, my lad, you’ll be able to pay her back her\n",
      "present tyrannies with a vigorous hand. You’re pining for pure love,\n",
      "are you not? nothing else in the world: and she shall have you! There,\n",
      "to bed! Zillah won’t be here to-night; you must undress yourself. Hush!\n",
      "hold your noise! Once in your own room, I’ll not come near you: you\n",
      "needn’t fear. By chance, you’ve managed tolerably. I’ll look to the\n",
      "rest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He spoke these words, holding the door open for his son to pass, and\n",
      "the latter achieved his exit exactly as a spaniel might which suspected\n",
      "the person who attended on it of designing a spiteful squeeze. The lock\n",
      "was re-secured. Heathcliff approached the fire, where my mistress and I\n",
      "stood silent. Catherine looked up, and instinctively raised her hand to\n",
      "her cheek: his neighbourhood revived a painful sensation. Anybody else\n",
      "would have been incapable of regarding the childish act with sternness,\n",
      "but he scowled on her and muttered—“Oh! you are not afraid of me? Your\n",
      "courage is well disguised: you _seem_ damnably afraid!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I _am_ afraid now,” she replied, “because, if I stay, papa will be\n",
      "miserable: and how can I endure making him miserable—when he—when\n",
      "he—Mr. Heathcliff, _let_ me go home! I promise to marry Linton: papa\n",
      "would like me to: and I love him. Why should you wish to force me to do\n",
      "what I’ll willingly do of myself?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Let him dare to force you,” I cried. “There’s law in the land, thank\n",
      "God! there is; though we be in an out-of-the-way place. I’d inform if\n",
      "he were my own son: and it’s felony without benefit of clergy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Silence!” said the ruffian. “To the devil with your clamour! I don’t\n",
      "want _you_ to speak. Miss Linton, I shall enjoy myself remarkably in\n",
      "thinking your father will be miserable: I shall not sleep for\n",
      "satisfaction. You could have hit on no surer way of fixing your\n",
      "residence under my roof for the next twenty-four hours than informing\n",
      "me that such an event would follow. As to your promise to marry Linton,\n",
      "I’ll take care you shall keep it; for you shall not quit this place\n",
      "till it is fulfilled.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Send Ellen, then, to let papa know I’m safe!” exclaimed Catherine,\n",
      "weeping bitterly. “Or marry me now. Poor papa! Ellen, he’ll think we’re\n",
      "lost. What shall we do?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Not he! He’ll think you are tired of waiting on him, and run off for a\n",
      "little amusement,” answered Heathcliff. “You cannot deny that you\n",
      "entered my house of your own accord, in contempt of his injunctions to\n",
      "the contrary. And it is quite natural that you should desire amusement\n",
      "at your age; and that you would weary of nursing a sick man, and that\n",
      "man _only_ your father. Catherine, his happiest days were over when\n",
      "your days began. He cursed you, I dare say, for coming into the world\n",
      "(I did, at least); and it would just do if he cursed you as _he_ went\n",
      "out of it. I’d join him. I don’t love you! How should I? Weep away. As\n",
      "far as I can see, it will be your chief diversion hereafter; unless\n",
      "Linton make amends for other losses: and your provident parent appears\n",
      "to fancy he may. His letters of advice and consolation entertained me\n",
      "vastly. In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his; and\n",
      "kind to her when he got her. Careful and kind—that’s paternal. But\n",
      "Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself.\n",
      "Linton can play the little tyrant well. He’ll undertake to torture any\n",
      "number of cats, if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared. You’ll\n",
      "be able to tell his uncle fine tales of his _kindness_, when you get\n",
      "home again, I assure you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’re right there!” I said; “explain your son’s character. Show his\n",
      "resemblance to yourself: and then, I hope, Miss Cathy will think twice\n",
      "before she takes the cockatrice!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I don’t much mind speaking of his amiable qualities now,” he answered;\n",
      "“because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner, and you along\n",
      "with her, till your master dies. I can detain you both, quite\n",
      "concealed, here. If you doubt, encourage her to retract her word, and\n",
      "you’ll have an opportunity of judging!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ll not retract my word,” said Catherine. “I’ll marry him within this\n",
      "hour, if I may go to Thrushcross Grange afterwards. Mr. Heathcliff,\n",
      "you’re a cruel man, but you’re not a fiend; and you won’t, from _mere_\n",
      "malice, destroy irrevocably all my happiness. If papa thought I had\n",
      "left him on purpose, and if he died before I returned, could I bear to\n",
      "live? I’ve given over crying: but I’m going to kneel here, at your\n",
      "knee; and I’ll not get up, and I’ll not take my eyes from your face\n",
      "till you look back at me! No, don’t turn away! _do_ look! you’ll see\n",
      "nothing to provoke you. I don’t hate you. I’m not angry that you struck\n",
      "me. Have you never loved _anybody_ in all your life, uncle? _never_?\n",
      "Ah! you must look once. I’m so wretched, you can’t help being sorry and\n",
      "pitying me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Keep your eft’s fingers off; and move, or I’ll kick you!” cried\n",
      "Heathcliff, brutally repulsing her. “I’d rather be hugged by a snake.\n",
      "How the devil can you dream of fawning on me? I _detest_ you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "He shrugged his shoulders: shook himself, indeed, as if his flesh crept\n",
      "with aversion; and thrust back his chair; while I got up, and opened my\n",
      "mouth, to commence a downright torrent of abuse. But I was rendered\n",
      "dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be\n",
      "shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered. It was\n",
      "growing dark—we heard a sound of voices at the garden-gate. Our host\n",
      "hurried out instantly: _he_ had his wits about him; _we_ had not. There\n",
      "was a talk of two or three minutes, and he returned alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I thought it had been your cousin Hareton,” I observed to Catherine.\n",
      "“I wish he would arrive! Who knows but he might take our part?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was three servants sent to seek you from the Grange,” said\n",
      "Heathcliff, overhearing me. “You should have opened a lattice and\n",
      "called out: but I could swear that chit is glad you didn’t. She’s glad\n",
      "to be obliged to stay, I’m certain.”\n",
      "\n",
      "At learning the chance we had missed, we both gave vent to our grief\n",
      "without control; and he allowed us to wail on till nine o’clock. Then\n",
      "he bid us go upstairs, through the kitchen, to Zillah’s chamber; and I\n",
      "whispered my companion to obey: perhaps we might contrive to get\n",
      "through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.\n",
      "The window, however, was narrow, like those below, and the garret trap\n",
      "was safe from our attempts; for we were fastened in as before. We\n",
      "neither of us lay down: Catherine took her station by the lattice, and\n",
      "watched anxiously for morning; a deep sigh being the only answer I\n",
      "could obtain to my frequent entreaties that she would try to rest. I\n",
      "seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro, passing harsh judgment\n",
      "on my many derelictions of duty; from which, it struck me then, all the\n",
      "misfortunes of my employers sprang. It was not the case, in reality, I\n",
      "am aware; but it was, in my imagination, that dismal night; and I\n",
      "thought Heathcliff himself less guilty than I.\n",
      "\n",
      "At seven o’clock he came, and inquired if Miss Linton had risen. She\n",
      "ran to the door immediately, and answered, “Yes.” “Here, then,” he\n",
      "said, opening it, and pulling her out. I rose to follow, but he turned\n",
      "the lock again. I demanded my release.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Be patient,” he replied; “I’ll send up your breakfast in a while.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I thumped on the panels, and rattled the latch angrily; and Catherine\n",
      "asked why I was still shut up? He answered, I must try to endure it\n",
      "another hour, and they went away. I endured it two or three hours; at\n",
      "length, I heard a footstep: not Heathcliff’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve brought you something to eat,” said a voice; “oppen t’ door!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Complying eagerly, I beheld Hareton, laden with food enough to last me\n",
      "all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Tak’ it,” he added, thrusting the tray into my hand.\n",
      "\n",

      "“Nay,” cried he, and retired, regardless of any prayers I could pour\n",
      "forth to detain him.\n",
      "\n",
      "And there I remained enclosed the whole day, and the whole of the next\n",
      "night; and another, and another. Five nights and four days I remained,\n",
      "altogether, seeing nobody but Hareton once every morning; and he was a\n",
      "model of a jailor: surly, and dumb, and deaf to every attempt at moving\n",

      "\n",
      "On the fifth morning, or rather afternoon, a different step\n",
      "approached—lighter and shorter; and, this time, the person entered the\n",
      "room. It was Zillah; donned in her scarlet shawl, with a black silk\n",
      "bonnet on her head, and a willow-basket swung to her arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eh, dear! Mrs. Dean!” she exclaimed. “Well! there is a talk about you\n",
      "at Gimmerton. I never thought but you were sunk in the Blackhorse\n",
      "marsh, and missy with you, till master told me you’d been found, and\n",
      "he’d lodged you here! What! and you must have got on an island, sure?\n",
      "And how long were you in the hole? Did master save you, Mrs. Dean? But\n",
      "you’re not so thin—you’ve not been so poorly, have you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Your master is a true scoundrel!” I replied. “But he shall answer for\n",
      "it. He needn’t have raised that tale: it shall all be laid bare!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What do you mean?” asked Zillah. “It’s not his tale: they tell that in\n",
      "the village—about your being lost in the marsh; and I calls to\n",
      "Earnshaw, when I come in—‘Eh, they’s queer things, Mr. Hareton,\n",
      "happened since I went off. It’s a sad pity of that likely young lass,\n",
      "and cant Nelly Dean.’ He stared. I thought he had not heard aught, so I\n",
      "told him the rumour. The master listened, and he just smiled to\n",
      "himself, and said, ‘If they have been in the marsh, they are out now,\n",
      "Zillah. Nelly Dean is lodged, at this minute, in your room. You can\n",
      "tell her to flit, when you go up; here is the key. The bog-water got\n",
      "into her head, and she would have run home quite flighty, but I fixed\n",
      "her till she came round to her senses. You can bid her go to the Grange\n",
      "at once, if she be able, and carry a message from me, that her young\n",
      "lady will follow in time to attend the squire’s funeral.’”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Edgar is not dead?” I gasped. “Oh! Zillah, Zillah!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no; sit you down, my good mistress,” she replied; “you’re right\n",
      "sickly yet. He’s not dead; Doctor Kenneth thinks he may last another\n",
      "day. I met him on the road and asked.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of sitting down, I snatched my outdoor things, and hastened\n",
      "below, for the way was free. On entering the house, I looked about for\n",
      "some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with\n",
      "sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I\n",
      "hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a\n",
      "slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle,\n",
      "sole tenant, sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements\n",
      "with apathetic eyes. “Where is Miss Catherine?” I demanded sternly,\n",
      "supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching\n",
      "him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is she gone?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No,” he replied; “she’s upstairs: she’s not to go; we won’t let her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You won’t let her, little idiot!” I exclaimed. “Direct me to her room\n",
      "immediately, or I’ll make you sing out sharply.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Papa would make you sing out, if you attempted to get there,” he\n",
      "answered. “He says I’m not to be soft with Catherine: she’s my wife,\n",

      "me and wants me to die, that she may have my money; but she shan’t have\n",

      "“Master Heathcliff,” I resumed, “have you forgotten all Catherine’s\n",
      "kindness to you last winter, when you affirmed you loved her, and when\n",
      "she brought you books and sung you songs, and came many a time through\n",
      "wind and snow to see you? She wept to miss one evening, because you\n",
      "would be disappointed; and you felt then that she was a hundred times\n",
      "too good to you: and now you believe the lies your father tells, though\n",
      "you know he detests you both. And you join him against her. That’s fine\n",
      "gratitude, is it not?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The corner of Linton’s mouth fell, and he took the sugar-candy from his\n",
      "lips.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Did she come to Wuthering Heights because she hated you?” I continued.\n",
      "“Think for yourself! As to your money, she does not even know that you\n",
      "will have any. And you say she’s sick; and yet you leave her alone, up\n",
      "there in a strange house! _You_ who have felt what it is to be so\n",
      "neglected! You could pity your own sufferings; and she pitied them,\n",
      "too; but you won’t pity hers! I shed tears, Master Heathcliff, you\n",
      "see—an elderly woman, and a servant merely—and you, after pretending\n",
      "such affection, and having reason to worship her almost, store every\n",
      "tear you have for yourself, and lie there quite at ease. Ah! you’re a\n",
      "heartless, selfish boy!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I can’t stay with her,” he answered crossly. “I’ll not stay by myself.\n",
      "She cries so I can’t bear it. And she won’t give over, though I say\n",
      "I’ll call my father. I did call him once, and he threatened to strangle\n",
      "her if she was not quiet; but she began again the instant he left the\n",
      "room, moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for\n",
      "vexation that I couldn’t sleep.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mr. Heathcliff out?” I inquired, perceiving that the wretched\n",
      "creature had no power to sympathise with his cousin’s mental tortures.\n",
      "\n",
      "“He’s in the court,” he replied, “talking to Doctor Kenneth; who says\n",
      "uncle is dying, truly, at last. I’m glad, for I shall be master of the\n",
      "Grange after him. Catherine always spoke of it as _her_ house. It isn’t\n",
      "hers! It’s mine: papa says everything she has is mine. All her nice\n",
      "books are mine; she offered to give me them, and her pretty birds, and\n",
      "her pony Minny, if I would get the key of our room, and let her out;\n",
      "but I told her she had nothing to give, they were all, all mine. And\n",
      "then she cried, and took a little picture from her neck, and said I\n",
      "should have that; two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother,\n",
      "and on the other uncle, when they were young. That was yesterday—I said\n",
      "_they_ were mine, too; and tried to get them from her. The spiteful\n",
      "thing wouldn’t let me: she pushed me off, and hurt me. I shrieked\n",
      "out—that frightens her—she heard papa coming, and she broke the hinges\n",
      "and divided the case, and gave me her mother’s portrait; the other she\n",
      "attempted to hide: but papa asked what was the matter, and I explained\n",
      "it. He took the one I had away, and ordered her to resign hers to me;\n",
      "she refused, and he—he struck her down, and wrenched it off the chain,\n",
      "and crushed it with his foot.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And were you pleased to see her struck?” I asked: having my designs in\n",
      "encouraging his talk.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I winked,” he answered: “I wink to see my father strike a dog or a\n",
      "horse, he does it so hard. Yet I was glad at first—she deserved\n",
      "punishing for pushing me: but when papa was gone, she made me come to\n",
      "the window and showed me her cheek cut on the inside, against her\n",
      "teeth, and her mouth filling with blood; and then she gathered up the\n",
      "bits of the picture, and went and sat down with her face to the wall,\n",
      "and she has never spoken to me since: and I sometimes think she can’t\n",
      "speak for pain. I don’t like to think so; but she’s a naughty thing for\n",
      "crying continually; and she looks so pale and wild, I’m afraid of her.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And you can get the key if you choose?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, when I am upstairs,” he answered; “but I can’t walk upstairs\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“In what apartment is it?” I asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh,” he cried, “I shan’t tell _you_ where it is. It is our secret.\n",
      "Nobody, neither Hareton nor Zillah, is to know. There! you’ve tired\n",
      "me—go away, go away!” And he turned his face on to his arm, and shut\n",
      "his eyes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered it best to depart without seeing Mr. Heathcliff, and bring\n",
      "a rescue for my young lady from the Grange. On reaching it, the\n",
      "astonishment of my fellow-servants to see me, and their joy also, was\n",
      "intense; and when they heard that their little mistress was safe, two\n",
      "or three were about to hurry up and shout the news at Mr. Edgar’s door:\n",
      "but I bespoke the announcement of it myself. How changed I found him,\n",
      "even in those few days! He lay an image of sadness and resignation\n",
      "awaiting his death. Very young he looked: though his actual age was\n",
      "thirty-nine, one would have called him ten years younger, at least. He\n",
      "thought of Catherine; for he murmured her name. I touched his hand, and\n",
      "spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Catherine is coming, dear master!” I whispered; “she is alive and\n",
      "well; and will be here, I hope, to-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence: he half rose up,\n",
      "looked eagerly round the apartment, and then sank back in a swoon. As\n",
      "soon as he recovered, I related our compulsory visit, and detention at\n",
      "the Heights. I said Heathcliff forced me to go in: which was not quite\n",
      "true. I uttered as little as possible against Linton; nor did I\n",
      "describe all his father’s brutal conduct—my intentions being to add no\n",
      "bitterness, if I could help it, to his already overflowing cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "He divined that one of his enemy’s purposes was to secure the personal\n",
      "property, as well as the estate, to his son: or rather himself; yet why\n",
      "he did not wait till his decease was a puzzle to my master, because\n",
      "ignorant how nearly he and his nephew would quit the world together.\n",
      "However, he felt that his will had better be altered: instead of\n",
      "leaving Catherine’s fortune at her own disposal, he determined to put\n",
      "it in the hands of trustees for her use during life, and for her\n",
      "children, if she had any, after her. By that means, it could not fall\n",
      "to Mr. Heathcliff should Linton die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having received his orders, I despatched a man to fetch the attorney,\n",
      "and four more, provided with serviceable weapons, to demand my young\n",
      "lady of her jailor. Both parties were delayed very late. The single\n",
      "servant returned first. He said Mr. Green, the lawyer, was out when he\n",
      "arrived at his house, and he had to wait two hours for his re-entrance;\n",
      "and then Mr. Green told him he had a little business in the village\n",
      "that must be done; but he would be at Thrushcross Grange before\n",
      "morning. The four men came back unaccompanied also. They brought word\n",
      "that Catherine was ill: too ill to quit her room; and Heathcliff would\n",
      "not suffer them to see her. I scolded the stupid fellows well for\n",
      "listening to that tale, which I would not carry to my master; resolving\n",
      "to take a whole bevy up to the Heights, at daylight, and storm it\n",
      "literally, unless the prisoner were quietly surrendered to us. Her\n",
      "father _shall_ see her, I vowed, and vowed again, if that devil be\n",
      "killed on his own door-stones in trying to prevent it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, I was spared the journey and the trouble. I had gone\n",
      "downstairs at three o’clock to fetch a jug of water; and was passing\n",
      "through the hall with it in my hand, when a sharp knock at the front\n",
      "door made me jump. “Oh! it is Green,” I said, recollecting myself—“only\n",
      "Green,” and I went on, intending to send somebody else to open it; but\n",
      "the knock was repeated: not loud, and still importunately. I put the\n",
      "jug on the banister and hastened to admit him myself. The harvest moon\n",
      "shone clear outside. It was not the attorney. My own sweet little\n",
      "mistress sprang on my neck sobbing, “Ellen, Ellen! Is papa alive?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes,” I cried: “yes, my angel, he is, God be thanked, you are safe\n",
      "with us again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She wanted to run, breathless as she was, upstairs to Mr. Linton’s\n",
      "room; but I compelled her to sit down on a chair, and made her drink,\n",
      "and washed her pale face, chafing it into a faint colour with my apron.\n",
      "Then I said I must go first, and tell of her arrival; imploring her to\n",
      "say, she should be happy with young Heathcliff. She stared, but soon\n",
      "comprehending why I counselled her to utter the falsehood, she assured\n",
      "me she would not complain.\n",
      "\n",
      "I couldn’t abide to be present at their meeting. I stood outside the\n",
      "chamber-door a quarter of an hour, and hardly ventured near the bed,\n",
      "then. All was composed, however: Catherine’s despair was as silent as\n",
      "her father’s joy. She supported him calmly, in appearance; and he fixed\n",
      "on her features his raised eyes that seemed dilating with ecstasy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He died blissfully, Mr. Lockwood: he died so. Kissing her cheek, he\n",
      "murmured,—“I am going to her; and you, darling child, shall come to\n",
      "us!” and never stirred or spoke again; but continued that rapt, radiant\n",
      "gaze, till his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed. None\n",
      "could have noticed the exact minute of his death, it was so entirely\n",
      "without a struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Catherine had spent her tears, or whether the grief were too\n",
      "weighty to let them flow, she sat there dry-eyed till the sun rose: she\n",
      "sat till noon, and would still have remained brooding over that\n",
      "deathbed, but I insisted on her coming away and taking some repose. It\n",
      "was well I succeeded in removing her, for at dinner-time appeared the\n",
      "lawyer, having called at Wuthering Heights to get his instructions how\n",
      "to behave. He had sold himself to Mr. Heathcliff: that was the cause of\n",
      "his delay in obeying my master’s summons. Fortunately, no thought of\n",
      "worldly affairs crossed the latter’s mind, to disturb him, after his\n",
      "daughter’s arrival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Green took upon himself to order everything and everybody about the\n",
      "place. He gave all the servants but me, notice to quit. He would have\n",
      "carried his delegated authority to the point of insisting that Edgar\n",
      "Linton should not be buried beside his wife, but in the chapel, with\n",
      "his family. There was the will, however, to hinder that, and my loud\n",
      "protestations against any infringement of its directions. The funeral\n",
      "was hurried over; Catherine, Mrs. Linton Heathcliff now, was suffered\n",
      "to stay at the Grange till her father’s corpse had quitted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She told me that her anguish had at last spurred Linton to incur the\n",
      "risk of liberating her. She heard the men I sent disputing at the door,\n",
      "and she gathered the sense of Heathcliff’s answer. It drove her\n",
      "desperate. Linton who had been conveyed up to the little parlour soon\n",
      "after I left, was terrified into fetching the key before his father\n",
      "re-ascended. He had the cunning to unlock and re-lock the door, without\n",
      "shutting it; and when he should have gone to bed, he begged to sleep\n",
      "with Hareton, and his petition was granted for once. Catherine stole\n",
      "out before break of day. She dared not try the doors lest the dogs\n",
      "should raise an alarm; she visited the empty chambers and examined\n",
      "their windows; and, luckily, lighting on her mother’s, she got easily\n",
      "out of its lattice, and on to the ground, by means of the fir-tree\n",
      "close by. Her accomplice suffered for his share in the escape,\n",
      "notwithstanding his timid contrivances.\n",

      "CHAPTER XXIX\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The evening after the funeral, my young lady and I were seated in the\n",
      "library; now musing mournfully—one of us despairingly—on our loss, now\n",
      "venturing conjectures as to the gloomy future.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had just agreed the best destiny which could await Catherine would\n",
      "be a permission to continue resident at the Grange; at least during\n",
      "Linton’s life: he being allowed to join her there, and I to remain as\n",
      "housekeeper. That seemed rather too favourable an arrangement to be\n",
      "hoped for; and yet I did hope, and began to cheer up under the prospect\n",
      "of retaining my home and my employment, and, above all, my beloved\n",
      "young mistress; when a servant—one of the discarded ones, not yet\n",
      "departed—rushed hastily in, and said “that devil Heathcliff” was coming\n",
      "through the court: should he fasten the door in his face?\n",
      "\n",
      "If we had been mad enough to order that proceeding, we had not time. He\n",
      "made no ceremony of knocking or announcing his name: he was master, and\n",
      "availed himself of the master’s privilege to walk straight in, without\n",
      "saying a word. The sound of our informant’s voice directed him to the\n",
      "library; he entered and motioning him out, shut the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was the same room into which he had been ushered, as a guest,\n",
      "eighteen years before: the same moon shone through the window; and the\n",
      "same autumn landscape lay outside. We had not yet lighted a candle, but\n",
      "all the apartment was visible, even to the portraits on the wall: the\n",
      "splendid head of Mrs. Linton, and the graceful one of her husband.\n",
      "Heathcliff advanced to the hearth. Time had little altered his person\n",
      "either. There was the same man: his dark face rather sallower and more\n",
      "composed, his frame a stone or two heavier, perhaps, and no other\n",
      "difference. Catherine had risen with an impulse to dash out, when she\n",
      "saw him.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Stop!” he said, arresting her by the arm. “No more runnings away!\n",
      "Where would you go? I’m come to fetch you home; and I hope you’ll be a\n",
      "dutiful daughter and not encourage my son to further disobedience. I\n",
      "was embarrassed how to punish him when I discovered his part in the\n",
      "business: he’s such a cobweb, a pinch would annihilate him; but you’ll\n",
      "see by his look that he has received his due! I brought him down one\n",
      "evening, the day before yesterday, and just set him in a chair, and\n",
      "never touched him afterwards. I sent Hareton out, and we had the room\n",
      "to ourselves. In two hours, I called Joseph to carry him up again; and\n",
      "since then my presence is as potent on his nerves as a ghost; and I\n",
      "fancy he sees me often, though I am not near. Hareton says he wakes and\n",
      "shrieks in the night by the hour together, and calls you to protect him\n",
      "from me; and, whether you like your precious mate, or not, you must\n",
      "come: he’s your concern now; I yield all my interest in him to you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why not let Catherine continue here,” I pleaded, “and send Master\n",
      "Linton to her? As you hate them both, you’d not miss them: they _can_\n",
      "only be a daily plague to your unnatural heart.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m seeking a tenant for the Grange,” he answered; “and I want my\n",
      "children about me, to be sure. Besides, that lass owes me her services\n",
      "for her bread. I’m not going to nurture her in luxury and idleness\n",
      "after Linton is gone. Make haste and get ready, now; and don’t oblige\n",
      "me to compel you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I shall,” said Catherine. “Linton is all I have to love in the world,\n",
      "and though you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and\n",
      "me to him, you _cannot_ make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt\n",
      "him when I am by, and I defy you to frighten me!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You are a boastful champion,” replied Heathcliff; “but I don’t like\n",
      "you well enough to hurt him: you shall get the full benefit of the\n",
      "torment, as long as it lasts. It is not I who will make him hateful to\n",
      "you—it is his own sweet spirit. He’s as bitter as gall at your\n",
      "desertion and its consequences: don’t expect thanks for this noble\n",
      "devotion. I heard him draw a pleasant picture to Zillah of what he\n",
      "would do if he were as strong as I: the inclination is there, and his\n",
      "very weakness will sharpen his wits to find a substitute for strength.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I know he has a bad nature,” said Catherine: “he’s your son. But I’m\n",
      "glad I’ve a better, to forgive it; and I know he loves me, and for that\n",
      "reason I love him. Mr. Heathcliff, _you_ have _nobody_ to love you;\n",
      "and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of\n",
      "thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You _are_\n",
      "miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him?\n",
      "_Nobody_ loves you—_nobody_ will cry for you when you die! I wouldn’t\n",
      "be you!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Catherine spoke with a kind of dreary triumph: she seemed to have made\n",
      "up her mind to enter into the spirit of her future family, and draw\n",
      "pleasure from the griefs of her enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You shall be sorry to be yourself presently,” said her father-in-law,\n",
      "“if you stand there another minute. Begone, witch, and get your\n",
      "things!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She scornfully withdrew. In her absence I began to beg for Zillah’s\n",
      "place at the Heights, offering to resign mine to her; but he would\n",
      "suffer it on no account. He bid me be silent; and then, for the first\n",
      "time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the\n",
      "pictures. Having studied Mrs. Linton’s, he said—“I shall have that\n",
      "home. Not because I need it, but—” He turned abruptly to the fire, and\n",
      "continued, with what, for lack of a better word, I must call a\n",
      "smile—“I’ll tell you what I did yesterday! I got the sexton, who was\n",
      "digging Linton’s grave, to remove the earth off her coffin lid, and I\n",
      "opened it. I thought, once, I would have stayed there: when I saw her\n",
      "face again—it is hers yet!—he had hard work to stir me; but he said it\n",
      "would change if the air blew on it, and so I struck one side of the\n",
      "coffin loose, and covered it up: not Linton’s side, damn him! I wish\n",
      "he’d been soldered in lead. And I bribed the sexton to pull it away\n",
      "when I’m laid there, and slide mine out too; I’ll have it made so: and\n",
      "then by the time Linton gets to us he’ll not know which is which!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“You were very wicked, Mr. Heathcliff!” I exclaimed; “were you not\n",
      "ashamed to disturb the dead?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I disturbed nobody, Nelly,” he replied; “and I gave some ease to\n",
      "myself. I shall be a great deal more comfortable now; and you’ll have a\n",
      "better chance of keeping me underground, when I get there. Disturbed\n",
      "her? No! she has disturbed me, night and day, through eighteen\n",
      "years—incessantly—remorselessly—till yesternight; and yesternight I was\n",
      "tranquil. I dreamt I was sleeping the last sleep by that sleeper, with\n",
      "my heart stopped and my cheek frozen against hers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And if she had been dissolved into earth, or worse, what would you\n",
      "have dreamt of then?” I said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Of dissolving with her, and being more happy still!” he answered. “Do\n",
      "you suppose I dread any change of that sort? I expected such a\n",
      "transformation on raising the lid, but I’m better pleased that it should\n",
      "not commence till I share it. Besides, unless I had received a distinct\n",
      "impression of her passionless features, that strange feeling would\n",
      "hardly have been removed. It began oddly. You know I was wild after she\n",
      "died; and eternally, from dawn to dawn, praying her to return to me her\n",
      "spirit! I have a strong faith in ghosts: I have a conviction that they\n",
      "can, and do, exist among us! The day she was buried, there came a fall\n",
      "of snow. In the evening I went to the churchyard. It blew bleak as\n",
      "winter—all round was solitary. I didn’t fear that her fool of a husband\n",
      "would wander up the glen so late; and no one else had business to bring\n",
      "them there. Being alone, and conscious two yards of loose earth was the\n",
      "sole barrier between us, I said to myself—‘I’ll have her in my arms\n",
      "again! If she be cold, I’ll think it is this north wind that chills\n",
      "_me_; and if she be motionless, it is sleep.’ I got a spade from the\n",
      "tool-house, and began to delve with all my might—it scraped the coffin;\n",
      "I fell to work with my hands; the wood commenced cracking about the\n",
      "screws; I was on the point of attaining my object, when it seemed that\n",
      "I heard a sigh from some one above, close at the edge of the grave, and\n",

      "may shovel in the earth over us both!’ and I wrenched at it more\n",
      "desperately still. There was another sigh, close at my ear. I appeared\n",
      "to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind. I knew\n",
      "no living thing in flesh and blood was by; but, as certainly as you\n",
      "perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark, though it\n",
      "cannot be discerned, so certainly I felt that Cathy was there: not\n",
      "under me, but on the earth. A sudden sense of relief flowed from my\n",
      "heart through every limb. I relinquished my labour of agony, and turned\n",
      "consoled at once: unspeakably consoled. Her presence was with me: it\n",
      "remained while I re-filled the grave, and led me home. You may laugh,\n",
      "if you will; but I was sure I should see her there. I was sure she was\n",
      "with me, and I could not help talking to her. Having reached the\n",
      "Heights, I rushed eagerly to the door. It was fastened; and, I\n",
      "remember, that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance. I\n",
      "remember stopping to kick the breath out of him, and then hurrying\n",
      "upstairs, to my room and hers. I looked round impatiently—I felt her by\n",
      "me—I could _almost_ see her, and yet I _could not_! I ought to have\n",
      "sweat blood then, from the anguish of my yearning—from the fervour of\n",
      "my supplications to have but one glimpse! I had not one. She showed\n",
      "herself, as she often was in life, a devil to me! And, since then,\n",
      "sometimes more and sometimes less, I’ve been the sport of that\n",
      "intolerable torture! Infernal! keeping my nerves at such a stretch\n",
      "that, if they had not resembled catgut, they would long ago have\n",
      "relaxed to the feebleness of Linton’s. When I sat in the house with\n",
      "Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when I walked\n",
      "on the moors I should meet her coming in. When I went from home I\n",
      "hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights, I was\n",
      "certain! And when I slept in her chamber—I was beaten out of that. I\n",
      "couldn’t lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\n",
      "outside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room,\n",
      "or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a\n",
      "child; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them\n",
      "a hundred times a night—to be always disappointed! It racked me! I’ve\n",
      "often groaned aloud, till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that\n",
      "my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me. Now, since I’ve seen\n",
      "her, I’m pacified—a little. It was a strange way of killing: not by\n",
      "inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me with the\n",
      "spectre of a hope through eighteen years!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff paused and wiped his forehead; his hair clung to it, wet\n",
      "with perspiration; his eyes were fixed on the red embers of the fire,\n",
      "the brows not contracted, but raised next the temples; diminishing the\n",
      "grim aspect of his countenance, but imparting a peculiar look of\n",
      "trouble, and a painful appearance of mental tension towards one\n",
      "absorbing subject. He only half addressed me, and I maintained silence.\n",
      "I didn’t like to hear him talk! After a short period he resumed his\n",
      "meditation on the picture, took it down and leant it against the sofa\n",
      "to contemplate it at better advantage; and while so occupied Catherine\n",
      "entered, announcing that she was ready, when her pony should be\n",
      "saddled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Send that over to-morrow,” said Heathcliff to me; then turning to her,\n",
      "he added: “You may do without your pony: it is a fine evening, and\n",
      "you’ll need no ponies at Wuthering Heights; for what journeys you take,\n",
      "your own feet will serve you. Come along.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Good-bye, Ellen!” whispered my dear little mistress. As she kissed me,\n",

      "He signed her to precede him; and casting back a look that cut my\n",
      "heart, she obeyed. I watched them, from the window, walk down the\n",
      "garden. Heathcliff fixed Catherine’s arm under his: though she disputed\n",

      "I have paid a visit to the Heights, but I have not seen her since she\n",
      "left: Joseph held the door in his hand when I called to ask after her,\n",
      "and wouldn’t let me pass. He said Mrs. Linton was “thrang,” and the\n",
      "master was not in. Zillah has told me something of the way they go on,\n",
      "otherwise I should hardly know who was dead and who living. She thinks\n",
      "Catherine haughty, and does not like her, I can guess by her talk. My\n",
      "young lady asked some aid of her when she first came; but Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff told her to follow her own business, and let his\n",
      "daughter-in-law look after herself; and Zillah willingly acquiesced,\n",
      "being a narrow-minded, selfish woman. Catherine evinced a child’s\n",
      "annoyance at this neglect; repaid it with contempt, and thus enlisted\n",
      "my informant among her enemies, as securely as if she had done her some\n",
      "great wrong. I had a long talk with Zillah about six weeks ago, a\n",
      "little before you came, one day when we foregathered on the moor; and\n",
      "this is what she told me.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The first thing Mrs. Linton did,” she said, “on her arrival at the\n",
      "Heights, was to run upstairs, without even wishing good-evening to me\n",
      "and Joseph; she shut herself into Linton’s room, and remained till\n",
      "morning. Then, while the master and Earnshaw were at breakfast, she\n",
      "entered the house, and asked all in a quiver if the doctor might be\n",
      "sent for? her cousin was very ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘We know that!’ answered Heathcliff; ‘but his life is not worth a\n",
      "farthing, and I won’t spend a farthing on him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘But I cannot tell how to do,’ she said; ‘and if nobody will help me,\n",
      "he’ll die!’\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘Walk out of the room,’ cried the master, ‘and let me never hear a\n",
      "word more about him! None here care what becomes of him; if you do, act\n",
      "the nurse; if you do not, lock him up and leave him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then she began to bother me, and I said I’d had enough plague with the\n",
      "tiresome thing; we each had our tasks, and hers was to wait on Linton:\n",
      "Mr. Heathcliff bid me leave that labour to her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How they managed together, I can’t tell. I fancy he fretted a great\n",
      "deal, and moaned hisseln night and day; and she had precious little\n",
      "rest: one could guess by her white face and heavy eyes. She sometimes\n",
      "came into the kitchen all wildered like, and looked as if she would\n",
      "fain beg assistance; but I was not going to disobey the master: I never\n",
      "dare disobey him, Mrs. Dean; and, though I thought it wrong that\n",
      "Kenneth should not be sent for, it was no concern of mine either to\n",
      "advise or complain, and I always refused to meddle. Once or twice,\n",
      "after we had gone to bed, I’ve happened to open my door again and seen\n",
      "her sitting crying on the stairs’-top; and then I’ve shut myself in\n",
      "quick, for fear of being moved to interfere. I did pity her then, I’m\n",
      "sure: still I didn’t wish to lose my place, you know.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At last, one night she came boldly into my chamber, and frightened me\n",
      "out of my wits, by saying, ‘Tell Mr. Heathcliff that his son is\n",
      "dying—I’m sure he is, this time. Get up, instantly, and tell him.’\n",
      "\n",
      "“Having uttered this speech, she vanished again. I lay a quarter of an\n",

      "\n",
      "“She’s mistaken, I said to myself. He’s got over it. I needn’t disturb\n",

      "sharp ringing of the bell—the only bell we have, put up on purpose for\n",

      "inform them that he wouldn’t have that noise repeated.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I delivered Catherine’s message. He cursed to himself, and in a few\n",
      "minutes came out with a lighted candle, and proceeded to their room. I\n",
      "followed. Mrs. Heathcliff was seated by the bedside, with her hands\n",
      "folded on her knees. Her father-in-law went up, held the light to\n",

      "heard our talk from outside, now entered. Joseph was fain, I believe,\n",
      "of the lad’s removal; Hareton seemed a thought bothered: though he was\n",
      "more taken up with staring at Catherine than thinking of Linton. But\n",
      "the master bid him get off to bed again: we didn’t want his help. He\n",
      "afterwards made Joseph remove the body to his chamber, and told me to\n",

      "\n",
      "“In the morning, he sent me to tell her she must come down to\n",

      "Cathy stayed upstairs a fortnight, according to Zillah; who visited her\n",
      "twice a day, and would have been rather more friendly, but her attempts\n",
      "at increasing kindness were proudly and promptly repelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff went up once, to show her Linton’s will. He had bequeathed\n",
      "the whole of his, and what had been her, moveable property, to his\n",
      "father: the poor creature was threatened, or coaxed, into that act\n",
      "during her week’s absence, when his uncle died. The lands, being a\n",
      "minor, he could not meddle with. However, Mr. Heathcliff has claimed\n",
      "and kept them in his wife’s right and his also: I suppose legally; at\n",

      "\n",
      "“Nobody,” said Zillah, “ever approached her door, except that once, but\n",
      "I; and nobody asked anything about her. The first occasion of her\n",
      "coming down into the house was on a Sunday afternoon. She had cried\n",
      "out, when I carried up her dinner, that she couldn’t bear any longer\n",
      "being in the cold; and I told her the master was going to Thrushcross\n",
      "Grange, and Earnshaw and I needn’t hinder her from descending; so, as\n",
      "soon as she heard Heathcliff’s horse trot off, she made her appearance,\n",

      "or Baptists’ place, I can’t say which it is, at Gimmerton, a chapel.)\n",
      "“Joseph had gone,” she continued, “but I thought proper to bide at\n",
      "home. Young folks are always the better for an elder’s over-looking;\n",
      "and Hareton, with all his bashfulness, isn’t a model of nice behaviour.\n",
      "I let him know that his cousin would very likely sit with us, and she\n",
      "had been always used to see the Sabbath respected; so he had as good\n",
      "leave his guns and bits of indoor work alone, while she stayed. He\n",
      "coloured up at the news, and cast his eyes over his hands and clothes.\n",
      "The train-oil and gunpowder were shoved out of sight in a minute. I saw\n",
      "he meant to give her his company; and I guessed, by his way, he wanted\n",
      "to be presentable; so, laughing, as I durst not laugh when the master\n",
      "is by, I offered to help him, if he would, and joked at his confusion.\n",
      "He grew sullen, and began to swear.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now, Mrs. Dean,” Zillah went on, seeing me not pleased by her manner,\n",
      "“you happen think your young lady too fine for Mr. Hareton; and happen\n",
      "you’re right: but I own I should love well to bring her pride a peg\n",
      "lower. And what will all her learning and her daintiness do for her,\n",
      "now? She’s as poor as you or I: poorer, I’ll be bound: you’re saving,\n",
      "and I’m doing my little all that road.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton allowed Zillah to give him her aid; and she flattered him into\n",

      "“Missis walked in,” she said, “as chill as an icicle, and as high as a\n",

      "turned up her nose at my civility. Earnshaw rose, too, and bid her come\n",
      "to the settle, and sit close by the fire: he was sure she was starved.\n",
      "\n",
      "“‘I’ve been starved a month and more,’ she answered, resting on the\n",

      "of us. Having sat till she was warm, she began to look round, and\n",
      "discovered a number of books on the dresser; she was instantly upon her\n",
      "feet again, stretching to reach them: but they were too high up. Her\n",
      "cousin, after watching her endeavours a while, at last summoned courage\n",
      "to help her; she held her frock, and he filled it with the first that\n",
      "came to hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That was a great advance for the lad. She didn’t thank him; still, he\n",
      "felt gratified that she had accepted his assistance, and ventured to\n",
      "stand behind as she examined them, and even to stoop and point out what\n",
      "struck his fancy in certain old pictures which they contained; nor was\n",
      "he daunted by the saucy style in which she jerked the page from his\n",
      "finger: he contented himself with going a bit farther back and looking\n",
      "at her instead of the book. She continued reading, or seeking for\n",
      "something to read. His attention became, by degrees, quite centred in\n",
      "the study of her thick silky curls: her face he couldn’t see, and she\n",
      "couldn’t see him. And, perhaps, not quite awake to what he did, but\n",
      "attracted like a child to a candle, at last he proceeded from staring\n",
      "to touching; he put out his hand and stroked one curl, as gently as if\n",
      "it were a bird. He might have stuck a knife into her neck, she started\n",
      "round in such a taking.\n",
      "\n",

      "me to believe. She’s a beauty, it is true; but not an angel.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnshaw surlily bid her remove her things to the kitchen. “Remove them\n",
      "yourself,” she said, pushing them from her as soon as she had done; and\n",
      "retiring to a stool by the window, where she began to carve figures of\n",
      "birds and beasts out of the turnip-parings in her lap. I approached\n",
      "her, pretending to desire a view of the garden; and, as I fancied,\n",
      "adroitly dropped Mrs. Dean’s note on to her knee, unnoticed by\n",
      "Hareton—but she asked aloud, “What is that?” And chucked it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A letter from your old acquaintance, the housekeeper at the Grange,” I\n",
      "answered; annoyed at her exposing my kind deed, and fearful lest it\n",
      "should be imagined a missive of my own. She would gladly have gathered\n",
      "it up at this information, but Hareton beat her; he seized and put it\n",
      "in his waistcoat, saying Mr. Heathcliff should look at it first.\n",
      "Thereat, Catherine silently turned her face from us, and, very\n",
      "stealthily, drew out her pocket-handkerchief and applied it to her\n",
      "eyes; and her cousin, after struggling awhile to keep down his softer\n",
      "feelings, pulled out the letter and flung it on the floor beside her,\n",
      "as ungraciously as he could. Catherine caught and perused it eagerly;\n",
      "then she put a few questions to me concerning the inmates, rational and\n",
      "irrational, of her former home; and gazing towards the hills, murmured\n",
      "in soliloquy:\n",

      "“I should like to be riding Minny down there! I should like to be\n",
      "climbing up there! Oh! I’m tired—I’m _stalled_, Hareton!” And she leant\n",
      "her pretty head back against the sill, with half a yawn and half a\n",
      "sigh, and lapsed into an aspect of abstracted sadness: neither caring\n",
      "nor knowing whether we remarked her.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mrs. Heathcliff,” I said, after sitting some time mute, “you are not\n",
      "aware that I am an acquaintance of yours? so intimate that I think it\n",
      "strange you won’t come and speak to me. My housekeeper never wearies of\n",
      "talking about and praising you; and she’ll be greatly disappointed if I\n",
      "return with no news of or from you, except that you received her letter\n",
      "and said nothing!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She appeared to wonder at this speech, and asked,—\n",
      "\n",
      "“Does Ellen like you?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, very well,” I replied, hesitatingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You must tell her,” she continued, “that I would answer her letter,\n",
      "but I have no materials for writing: not even a book from which I might\n",
      "tear a leaf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No books!” I exclaimed. “How do you contrive to live here without\n",
      "them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though provided with a\n",
      "large library, I’m frequently very dull at the Grange; take my books\n",
      "away, and I should be desperate!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I was always reading, when I had them,” said Catherine; “and Mr.\n",
      "Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to destroy my\n",
      "books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks. Only once, I searched\n",
      "through Joseph’s store of theology, to his great irritation; and once,\n",
      "Hareton, I came upon a secret stock in your room—some Latin and Greek,\n",
      "and some tales and poetry: all old friends. I brought the last here—and\n",
      "you gathered them, as a magpie gathers silver spoons, for the mere love\n",
      "of stealing! They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in\n",
      "the bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.\n",
      "Perhaps _your_ envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of my\n",
      "treasures? But I’ve most of them written on my brain and printed in my\n",
      "heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!”\n",
      "\n",
      "Earnshaw blushed crimson when his cousin made this revelation of his\n",
      "private literary accumulations, and stammered an indignant denial of\n",
      "her accusations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mr. Hareton is desirous of increasing his amount of knowledge,” I\n",
      "said, coming to his rescue. “He is not _envious_, but _emulous_ of your\n",
      "attainments. He’ll be a clever scholar in a few years.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“And he wants me to sink into a dunce, meantime,” answered Catherine.\n",
      "“Yes, I hear him trying to spell and read to himself, and pretty\n",
      "blunders he makes! I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did\n",
      "yesterday: it was extremely funny. I heard you; and I heard you turning\n",
      "over the dictionary to seek out the hard words, and then cursing\n",
      "because you couldn’t read their explanations!”\n",
      "\n",
      "The young man evidently thought it too bad that he should be laughed at\n",
      "for his ignorance, and then laughed at for trying to remove it. I had a\n",
      "similar notion; and, remembering Mrs. Dean’s anecdote of his first\n",
      "attempt at enlightening the darkness in which he had been reared, I\n",
      "observed,—“But, Mrs. Heathcliff, we have each had a commencement, and\n",
      "each stumbled and tottered on the threshold; had our teachers scorned\n",
      "instead of aiding us, we should stumble and totter yet.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh!” she replied, “I don’t wish to limit his acquirements: still, he\n",
      "has no right to appropriate what is mine, and make it ridiculous to me\n",
      "with his vile mistakes and mispronunciations! Those books, both prose\n",
      "and verse, are consecrated to me by other associations; and I hate to\n",
      "have them debased and profaned in his mouth! Besides, of all, he has\n",
      "selected my favourite pieces that I love the most to repeat, as if out\n",
      "of deliberate malice.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Hareton’s chest heaved in silence a minute: he laboured under a severe\n",
      "sense of mortification and wrath, which it was no easy task to\n",
      "suppress. I rose, and, from a gentlemanly idea of relieving his\n",
      "embarrassment, took up my station in the doorway, surveying the\n",
      "external prospect as I stood. He followed my example, and left the\n",
      "room; but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his\n",
      "hands, which he threw into Catherine’s lap, exclaiming,—“Take them! I\n",
      "never want to hear, or read, or think of them again!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I won’t have them now,” she answered. “I shall connect them with you,\n",
      "and hate them.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She opened one that had obviously been often turned over, and read a\n",
      "portion in the drawling tone of a beginner; then laughed, and threw it\n",
      "from her. “And listen,” she continued, provokingly, commencing a verse\n",
      "of an old ballad in the same fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his self-love would endure no further torment: I heard, and not\n",
      "altogether disapprovingly, a manual check given to her saucy tongue.\n",
      "The little wretch had done her utmost to hurt her cousin’s sensitive\n",
      "though uncultivated feelings, and a physical argument was the only mode\n",
      "he had of balancing the account, and repaying its effects on the\n",
      "inflictor. He afterwards gathered the books and hurled them on the\n",
      "fire. I read in his countenance what anguish it was to offer that\n",
      "sacrifice to spleen. I fancied that as they consumed, he recalled the\n",
      "pleasure they had already imparted, and the triumph and ever-increasing\n",
      "pleasure he had anticipated from them; and I fancied I guessed the\n",
      "incitement to his secret studies also. He had been content with daily\n",
      "labour and rough animal enjoyments, till Catherine crossed his path.\n",
      "Shame at her scorn, and hope of her approval, were his first prompters\n",
      "to higher pursuits; and instead of guarding him from one and winning\n",
      "him to the other, his endeavours to raise himself had produced just the\n",
      "contrary result.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Yes, that’s all the good that such a brute as you can get from them!”\n",
      "cried Catherine, sucking her damaged lip, and watching the\n",
      "conflagration with indignant eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You’d _better_ hold your tongue, now,” he answered fiercely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And his agitation precluded further speech; he advanced hastily to the\n",
      "entrance, where I made way for him to pass. But ere he had crossed the\n",
      "door-stones, Mr. Heathcliff, coming up the causeway, encountered him,\n",
      "and laying hold of his shoulder asked,—“What’s to do now, my lad?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Naught, naught,” he said, and broke away to enjoy his grief and anger\n",
      "in solitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heathcliff gazed after him, and sighed.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It will be odd if I thwart myself,” he muttered, unconscious that I\n",
      "was behind him. “But when I look for his father in his face, I find\n",
      "_her_ every day more! How the devil is he so like? I can hardly bear to\n",
      "see him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "He bent his eyes to the ground, and walked moodily in. There was a\n",
      "restless, anxious expression in his countenance, I had never remarked\n",
      "there before; and he looked sparer in person. His daughter-in-law, on\n",
      "perceiving him through the window, immediately escaped to the kitchen,\n",
      "so that I remained alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m glad to see you out of doors again, Mr. Lockwood,” he said, in\n",
      "reply to my greeting; “from selfish motives partly: I don’t think I\n",
      "could readily supply your loss in this desolation. I’ve wondered more\n",
      "than once what brought you here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“An idle whim, I fear, sir,” was my answer; “or else an idle whim is\n",
      "going to spirit me away. I shall set out for London next week; and I\n",
      "must give you warning that I feel no disposition to retain Thrushcross\n",
      "Grange beyond the twelve months I agreed to rent it. I believe I shall\n",
      "not live there any more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Oh, indeed; you’re tired of being banished from the world, are you?”\n",
      "he said. “But if you be coming to plead off paying for a place you\n",
      "won’t occupy, your journey is useless: I never relent in exacting my\n",
      "due from any one.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m coming to plead off nothing about it,” I exclaimed, considerably\n",
      "irritated. “Should you wish it, I’ll settle with you now,” and I drew\n",
      "my note-book from my pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, no,” he replied, coolly; “you’ll leave sufficient behind to cover\n",
      "your debts, if you fail to return: I’m not in such a hurry. Sit down\n",
      "and take your dinner with us; a guest that is safe from repeating his\n",

      "them.\n",

      "With Mr. Heathcliff, grim and saturnine, on the one hand, and Hareton,\n",
      "absolutely dumb, on the other, I made a somewhat cheerless meal, and\n",
      "bade adieu early. I would have departed by the back way, to get a last\n",
      "glimpse of Catherine and annoy old Joseph; but Hareton received orders\n",
      "to lead up my horse, and my host himself escorted me to the door, so I\n",
      "could not fulfil my wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How dreary life gets over in that house!” I reflected, while riding\n",

      "\n",
      "1802.—This September I was invited to devastate the moors of a friend\n",
      "in the north, and on my journey to his abode, I unexpectedly came\n",
      "within fifteen miles of Gimmerton. The ostler at a roadside\n",
      "public-house was holding a pail of water to refresh my horses, when a\n",
      "cart of very green oats, newly reaped, passed by, and he\n",
      "remarked,—“Yon’s frough Gimmerton, nah! They’re allas three wick’ after\n",
      "other folk wi’ ther harvest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Gimmerton?” I repeated—my residence in that locality had already grown\n",
      "dim and dreamy. “Ah! I know. How far is it from this?”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Happen fourteen mile o’er th’ hills; and a rough road,” he answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden impulse seized me to visit Thrushcross Grange. It was scarcely\n",
      "noon, and I conceived that I might as well pass the night under my own\n",
      "roof as in an inn. Besides, I could spare a day easily to arrange\n",
      "matters with my landlord, and thus save myself the trouble of invading\n",
      "the neighbourhood again. Having rested awhile, I directed my servant to\n",
      "inquire the way to the village; and, with great fatigue to our beasts,\n",
      "we managed the distance in some three hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left him there, and proceeded down the valley alone. The grey church\n",
      "looked greyer, and the lonely churchyard lonelier. I distinguished a\n",
      "moor-sheep cropping the short turf on the graves. It was sweet, warm\n",
      "weather—too warm for travelling; but the heat did not hinder me from\n",
      "enjoying the delightful scenery above and below: had I seen it nearer\n",
      "August, I’m sure it would have tempted me to waste a month among its\n",
      "solitudes. In winter nothing more dreary, in summer nothing more\n",
      "divine, than those glens shut in by hills, and those bluff, bold swells\n",
      "of heath.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reached the Grange before sunset, and knocked for admittance; but the\n",
      "family had retreated into the back premises, I judged, by one thin,\n",
      "blue wreath, curling from the kitchen chimney, and they did not hear. I\n",
      "rode into the court. Under the porch, a girl of nine or ten sat\n",
      "knitting, and an old woman reclined on the housesteps, smoking a\n",
      "meditative pipe.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is Mrs. Dean within?” I demanded of the dame.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Mistress Dean? Nay!” she answered, “she doesn’t bide here: shoo’s up\n",
      "at th’ Heights.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Are you the housekeeper, then?” I continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eea, Aw keep th’ hause,” she replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Well, I’m Mr. Lockwood, the master. Are there any rooms to lodge me\n",
      "in, I wonder? I wish to stay all night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“T’ maister!” she cried in astonishment. “Whet, whoiver knew yah wur\n",
      "coming? Yah sud ha’ send word. They’s nowt norther dry nor mensful\n",
      "abaht t’ place: nowt there isn’t!”\n",
      "\n",
      "She threw down her pipe and bustled in, the girl followed, and I\n",
      "entered too; soon perceiving that her report was true, and, moreover,\n",
      "that I had almost upset her wits by my unwelcome apparition, I bade her\n",
      "be composed. I would go out for a walk; and, meantime she must try to\n",
      "prepare a corner of a sitting-room for me to sup in, and a bedroom to\n",
      "sleep in. No sweeping and dusting, only good fire and dry sheets were\n",
      "necessary. She seemed willing to do her best; though she thrust the\n",
      "hearth-brush into the grates in mistake for the poker, and\n",
      "malappropriated several other articles of her craft: but I retired,\n",
      "confiding in her energy for a resting-place against my return.\n",
      "Wuthering Heights was the goal of my proposed excursion. An\n",
      "after-thought brought me back, when I had quitted the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“All well at the Heights?” I inquired of the woman.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eea, f’r owt ee knaw!” she answered, skurrying away with a pan of hot\n",
      "cinders.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have asked why Mrs. Dean had deserted the Grange, but it was\n",
      "impossible to delay her at such a crisis, so I turned away and made my\n",
      "exit, rambling leisurely along, with the glow of a sinking sun behind,\n",
      "and the mild glory of a rising moon in front—one fading, and the other\n",
      "brightening—as I quitted the park, and climbed the stony by-road\n",
      "branching off to Mr. Heathcliff’s dwelling. Before I arrived in sight\n",
      "of it, all that remained of day was a beamless amber light along the\n",
      "west: but I could see every pebble on the path, and every blade of\n",
      "grass, by that splendid moon. I had neither to climb the gate nor to\n",
      "knock—it yielded to my hand. That is an improvement, I thought. And I\n",
      "noticed another, by the aid of my nostrils; a fragrance of stocks and\n",
      "wallflowers wafted on the air from amongst the homely fruit-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both doors and lattices were open; and yet, as is usually the case in a\n",
      "coal-district, a fine red fire illumined the chimney: the comfort which\n",
      "the eye derives from it renders the extra heat endurable. But the house\n",
      "of Wuthering Heights is so large that the inmates have plenty of space\n",
      "for withdrawing out of its influence; and accordingly what inmates\n",
      "there were had stationed themselves not far from one of the windows. I\n",
      "could both see them and hear them talk before I entered, and looked and\n",
      "listened in consequence; being moved thereto by a mingled sense of\n",
      "curiosity and envy, that grew as I lingered.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Con-_trary_!” said a voice as sweet as a silver bell. “That for the\n",
      "third time, you dunce! I’m not going to tell you again. Recollect, or\n",
      "I’ll pull your hair!”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Contrary, then,” answered another, in deep but softened tones. “And\n",
      "now, kiss me, for minding so well.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“No, read it over first correctly, without a single mistake.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The male speaker began to read: he was a young man, respectably dressed\n",
      "and seated at a table, having a book before him. His handsome features\n",
      "glowed with pleasure, and his eyes kept impatiently wandering from the\n",
      "page to a small white hand over his shoulder, which recalled him by a\n",
      "smart slap on the cheek, whenever its owner detected such signs of\n",
      "inattention. Its owner stood behind; her light, shining ringlets\n",
      "blending, at intervals, with his brown locks, as she bent to\n",
      "superintend his studies; and her face—it was lucky he could not see her\n",
      "face, or he would never have been so steady. I could; and I bit my lip\n",
      "in spite, at having thrown away the chance I might have had of doing\n",
      "something besides staring at its smiting beauty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task was done, not free from further blunders; but the pupil\n",
      "claimed a reward, and received at least five kisses; which, however, he\n",
      "generously returned. Then they came to the door, and from their\n",
      "conversation I judged they were about to issue out and have a walk on\n",
      "the moors. I supposed I should be condemned in Hareton Earnshaw’s\n",
      "heart, if not by his mouth, to the lowest pit in the infernal regions\n",
      "if I showed my unfortunate person in his neighbourhood then; and\n",
      "feeling very mean and malignant, I skulked round to seek refuge in the\n",
      "kitchen. There was unobstructed admittance on that side also; and at\n",
      "the door sat my old friend Nelly Dean, sewing and singing a song; which\n",
      "was often interrupted from within by harsh words of scorn and\n",
      "intolerance, uttered in far from musical accents.\n",

      "answer to an unheard speech of Nelly’s. “It’s a blazing shame, that I\n",

      "to a dance.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Dean was about to recommence, when I advanced; and recognising me\n",

      " Now the material ends.Question: How does Catherine change throughout the course of the novel? [\\INST] Answer: Catherine goes through major development and change throughout the course of the novel. In the beginning, she is headstrong, passionate, and romantic. She falls deeply in love with Heathcliff, not caring about his low social status. However, after marrying Edgar Linton, gaining wealth and comfort, and having her beloved Heathcliff pushed away from her, Catherine becomes more reserved, reserved, and materialistic.  She begins to value social status and wealth more and seems to lose her passionate spirit. Although she still carries a flame for Heathcliff, her love becomes more complicated as it is mixed with resentment and anger towards him. By the end of the novel, Catherine has become hardened and cold, reflecting the toll that her difficult life has taken on her personality and spirit.\n"

       "{'output': \"Based on the passages provided, the major relationships among the characters in the book are:\\n\\n1. Dorothea and Casaubon: Dorothea was married to Casaubon, but their relationship was fraught with difficulties. Dorothea chafed under Casaubon's control and demands, and felt restricted by him. After Casaubon's death, Dorothea realizes that their marriage did not meet her soul's needs. \\n\\n2. Dorothea and Celia (her sister): They have a close but somewhat unequal relationship. Celia seems to view Dorothea as selfless and uninterested in material things, whereas Dorothea values her independence. \\n\\n3. Dorothea and Will Ladislaw: Their relationship is only hinted at in the passages provided, but it seems they may develop a romantic connection in the future. Dorothea has feelings for Will that surprise her.\\n\\n4. Dorothea and Mr. Farebrother: They appear to have a respectful and thoughtful relationship. Mr. Farebrother acts as a mentor and friend to Dorothea.\\n\\n5. Fred Vincy and Mary Garth: They have a longstanding affection for each other, though Mary has refused Fred's previous marriage proposals. Fred seeks Mr. Farebrother's help in determining Mary's feelings.\\n\\nSo in summary, the main relationships involve Dorothea's connections with her sister, late husband, a potential romantic interest, and a trusted friend and adviser. The book also touches on the relationship between Fred and Mary. The complexities and inequalities within some of these relationships are central to the story.\",\n",

       " 'instruction': 'Below is some paragraphs in the book, Middlemarch. Memorize the content and answer my question after the book.\\n \\n“You are not to go till Mr. Lydgate says you may go. And he has not\\nsaid so yet (here you are, nurse; take baby and walk up and down the\\ngallery). Besides, you have got a wrong notion in your head as usual,\\nDodo—I can see that: it vexes me.”\\n\\n“Where am I wrong, Kitty?” said Dorothea, quite meekly. She was almost\\nready now to think Celia wiser than herself, and was really wondering\\nwith some fear what her wrong notion was. Celia felt her advantage, and\\nwas determined to use it. None of them knew Dodo as well as she did, or\\nknew how to manage her. Since Celia’s baby was born, she had had a new\\nsense of her mental solidity and calm wisdom. It seemed clear that\\nwhere there was a baby, things were right enough, and that error, in\\ngeneral, was a mere lack of that central poising force.\\n\\n“I can see what you are thinking of as well as can be, Dodo,” said\\nCelia. “You are wanting to find out if there is anything uncomfortable\\nfor you to do now, only because Mr. Casaubon wished it. As if you had\\nnot been uncomfortable enough before. And he doesn’t deserve it, and\\nyou will find that out. He has behaved very badly. James is as angry\\nwith him as can be. And I had better tell you, to prepare you.”\\n\\n“Celia,” said Dorothea, entreatingly, “you distress me. Tell me at once\\nwhat you mean.” It glanced through her mind that Mr. Casaubon had left\\nthe property away from her—which would not be so very distressing.\\n\\n“Why, he has made a codicil to his will, to say the property was all to\\ngo away from you if you married—I mean—”\\n\\n“That is of no consequence,” said Dorothea, breaking in impetuously.\\n\\n“But if you married Mr. Ladislaw, not anybody else,” Celia went on with\\npersevering quietude. “Of course that is of no consequence in one\\nway—you never _would_ marry Mr. Ladislaw; but that only makes it worse\\nof Mr. Casaubon.”\\n\\nThe blood rushed to Dorothea’s face and neck painfully. But Celia was\\nadministering what she thought a sobering dose of fact. It was taking\\nup notions that had done Dodo’s health so much harm. So she went on in\\nher neutral tone, as if she had been remarking on baby’s robes.\\n\\n“James says so. He says it is abominable, and not like a gentleman. And\\nthere never was a better judge than James. It is as if Mr. Casaubon\\nwanted to make people believe that you would wish to marry Mr.\\nLadislaw—which is ridiculous. Only James says it was to hinder Mr.\\nLadislaw from wanting to marry you for your money—just as if he ever\\nwould think of making you an offer. Mrs. Cadwallader said you might as\\nwell marry an Italian with white mice! But I must just go and look at\\nbaby,” Celia added, without the least change of tone, throwing a light\\nshawl over her, and tripping away.\\n\\nDorothea by this time had turned cold again, and now threw herself back\\nhelplessly in her chair. She might have compared her experience at that\\nmoment to the vague, alarmed consciousness that her life was taking on\\na new form, that she was undergoing a metamorphosis in which memory\\nwould not adjust itself to the stirring of new organs. Everything was\\nchanging its aspect: her husband’s conduct, her own duteous feeling\\ntowards him, every struggle between them—and yet more, her whole\\nrelation to Will Ladislaw. Her world was in a state of convulsive\\nchange; the only thing she could say distinctly to herself was, that\\nshe must wait and think anew. One change terrified her as if it had\\nbeen a sin; it was a violent shock of repulsion from her departed\\nhusband, who had had hidden thoughts, perhaps perverting everything she\\nsaid and did. Then again she was conscious of another change which also\\nmade her tremulous; it was a sudden strange yearning of heart towards\\nWill Ladislaw. It had never before entered her mind that he could,\\nunder any circumstances, be her lover: conceive the effect of the\\nsudden revelation that another had thought of him in that light—that\\nperhaps he himself had been conscious of such a possibility,—and this\\nwith the hurrying, crowding vision of unfitting conditions, and\\nquestions not soon to be solved.\\n\\nIt seemed a long while—she did not know how long—before she heard Celia\\nsaying, “That will do, nurse; he will be quiet on my lap now. You can\\ngo to lunch, and let Garratt stay in the next room. What I think,\\nDodo,” Celia went on, observing nothing more than that Dorothea was\\nleaning back in her chair, and likely to be passive, “is that Mr.\\nCasaubon was spiteful. I never did like him, and James never did. I\\nthink the corners of his mouth were dreadfully spiteful. And now he has\\nbehaved in this way, I am sure religion does not require you to make\\nyourself uncomfortable about him. If he has been taken away, that is a\\nmercy, and you ought to be grateful. We should not grieve, should we,\\nbaby?” said Celia confidentially to that unconscious centre and poise\\nof the world, who had the most remarkable fists all complete even to\\nthe nails, and hair enough, really, when you took his cap off, to\\nmake—you didn’t know what:—in short, he was Bouddha in a Western form.\\n\\nAt this crisis Lydgate was announced, and one of the first things he\\nsaid was, “I fear you are not so well as you were, Mrs. Casaubon; have\\nyou been agitated? allow me to feel your pulse.” Dorothea’s hand was of\\na marble coldness.\\n\\n“She wants to go to Lowick, to look over papers,” said Celia. “She\\nought not, ought she?”\\n\\nLydgate did not speak for a few moments. Then he said, looking at\\nDorothea. “I hardly know. In my opinion Mrs. Casaubon should do what\\nwould give her the most repose of mind. That repose will not always\\ncome from being forbidden to act.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Dorothea, exerting herself, “I am sure that is wise.\\nThere are so many things which I ought to attend to. Why should I sit\\nhere idle?” Then, with an effort to recall subjects not connected with\\nher agitation, she added, abruptly, “You know every one in Middlemarch,\\nI think, Mr. Lydgate. I shall ask you to tell me a great deal. I have\\nserious things to do now. I have a living to give away. You know Mr.\\nTyke and all the—” But Dorothea’s effort was too much for her; she\\nbroke off and burst into sobs.\\n\\nLydgate made her drink a dose of sal volatile.\\n\\n“Let Mrs. Casaubon do as she likes,” he said to Sir James, whom he\\nasked to see before quitting the house. “She wants perfect freedom, I\\nthink, more than any other prescription.”\\n\\nHis attendance on Dorothea while her brain was excited, had enabled him\\nto form some true conclusions concerning the trials of her life. He\\nfelt sure that she had been suffering from the strain and conflict of\\nself-repression; and that she was likely now to feel herself only in\\nanother sort of pinfold than that from which she had been released.\\n\\nLydgate’s advice was all the easier for Sir James to follow when he\\nfound that Celia had already told Dorothea the unpleasant fact about\\nthe will. There was no help for it now—no reason for any further delay\\nin the execution of necessary business. And the next day Sir James\\ncomplied at once with her request that he would drive her to Lowick.\\n\\n“I have no wish to stay there at present,” said Dorothea; “I could\\nhardly bear it. I am much happier at Freshitt with Celia. I shall be\\nable to think better about what should be done at Lowick by looking at\\nit from a distance. And I should like to be at the Grange a little\\nwhile with my uncle, and go about in all the old walks and among the\\npeople in the village.”\\n\\n“Not yet, I think. Your uncle is having political company, and you are\\nbetter out of the way of such doings,” said Sir James, who at that\\nmoment thought of the Grange chiefly as a haunt of young Ladislaw’s.\\nBut no word passed between him and Dorothea about the objectionable\\npart of the will; indeed, both of them felt that the mention of it\\nbetween them would be impossible. Sir James was shy, even with men,\\nabout disagreeable subjects; and the one thing that Dorothea would have\\nchosen to say, if she had spoken on the matter at all, was forbidden to\\nher at present because it seemed to be a further exposure of her\\nhusband’s injustice. Yet she did wish that Sir James could know what\\nhad passed between her and her husband about Will Ladislaw’s moral\\nclaim on the property: it would then, she thought, be apparent to him\\nas it was to her, that her husband’s strange indelicate proviso had\\nbeen chiefly urged by his bitter resistance to that idea of claim, and\\nnot merely by personal feelings more difficult to talk about. Also, it\\nmust be admitted, Dorothea wished that this could be known for Will’s\\nsake, since her friends seemed to think of him as simply an object of\\nMr. Casaubon’s charity. Why should he be compared with an Italian\\ncarrying white mice? That word quoted from Mrs. Cadwallader seemed like\\na mocking travesty wrought in the dark by an impish finger.\\n\\nAt Lowick Dorothea searched desk and drawer—searched all her husband’s\\nplaces of deposit for private writing, but found no paper addressed\\nespecially to her, except that “Synoptical Tabulation,” which was\\nprobably only the beginning of many intended directions for her\\nguidance. In carrying out this bequest of labor to Dorothea, as in all\\nelse, Mr. Casaubon had been slow and hesitating, oppressed in the plan\\nof transmitting his work, as he had been in executing it, by the sense\\nof moving heavily in a dim and clogging medium: distrust of Dorothea’s\\ncompetence to arrange what he had prepared was subdued only by distrust\\nof any other redactor. But he had come at last to create a trust for\\nhimself out of Dorothea’s nature: she could do what she resolved to do:\\nand he willingly imagined her toiling under the fetters of a promise to\\nerect a tomb with his name upon it. (Not that Mr. Casaubon called the\\nfuture volumes a tomb; he called them the Key to all Mythologies.) But\\nthe months gained on him and left his plans belated: he had only had\\ntime to ask for that promise by which he sought to keep his cold grasp\\non Dorothea’s life.\\n\\nThe grasp had slipped away. Bound by a pledge given from the depths of\\nher pity, she would have been capable of undertaking a toil which her\\njudgment whispered was vain for all uses except that consecration of\\nfaithfulness which is a supreme use. But now her judgment, instead of\\nbeing controlled by duteous devotion, was made active by the\\nimbittering discovery that in her past union there had lurked the\\nhidden alienation of secrecy and suspicion. The living, suffering man\\nwas no longer before her to awaken her pity: there remained only the\\nretrospect of painful subjection to a husband whose thoughts had been\\nlower than she had believed, whose exorbitant claims for himself had\\neven blinded his scrupulous care for his own character, and made him\\ndefeat his own pride by shocking men of ordinary honor. As for the\\nproperty which was the sign of that broken tie, she would have been\\nglad to be free from it and have nothing more than her original fortune\\nwhich had been settled on her, if there had not been duties attached to\\nownership, which she ought not to flinch from. About this property many\\ntroublous questions insisted on rising: had she not been right in\\nthinking that the half of it ought to go to Will Ladislaw?—but was it\\nnot impossible now for her to do that act of justice? Mr. Casaubon had\\ntaken a cruelly effective means of hindering her: even with indignation\\nagainst him in her heart, any act that seemed a triumphant eluding of\\nhis purpose revolted her.\\n\\nAfter collecting papers of business which she wished to examine, she\\nlocked up again the desks and drawers—all empty of personal words for\\nher—empty of any sign that in her husband’s lonely brooding his heart\\nhad gone out to her in excuse or explanation; and she went back to\\nFreshitt with the sense that around his last hard demand and his last\\ninjurious assertion of his power, the silence was unbroken.\\n\\nDorothea tried now to turn her thoughts towards immediate duties, and\\none of these was of a kind which others were determined to remind her\\nof. Lydgate’s ear had caught eagerly her mention of the living, and as\\nsoon as he could, he reopened the subject, seeing here a possibility of\\nmaking amends for the casting-vote he had once given with an\\nill-satisfied conscience. “Instead of telling you anything about Mr.\\nTyke,” he said, “I should like to speak of another man—Mr. Farebrother,\\nthe Vicar of St. Botolph’s. His living is a poor one, and gives him a\\nstinted provision for himself and his family. His mother, aunt, and\\nsister all live with him, and depend upon him. I believe he has never\\nmarried because of them. I never heard such good preaching as his—such\\nplain, easy eloquence. He would have done to preach at St. Paul’s Cross\\nafter old Latimer. His talk is just as good about all subjects:\\noriginal, simple, clear. I think him a remarkable fellow: he ought to\\nhave done more than he has done.”\\n\\n“Why has he not done more?” said Dorothea, interested now in all who\\nhad slipped below their own intention.\\n\\n“That’s a hard question,” said Lydgate. “I find myself that it’s\\nuncommonly difficult to make the right thing work: there are so many\\nstrings pulling at once. Farebrother often hints that he has got into\\nthe wrong profession; he wants a wider range than that of a poor\\nclergyman, and I suppose he has no interest to help him on. He is very\\nfond of Natural History and various scientific matters, and he is\\nhampered in reconciling these tastes with his position. He has no money\\nto spare—hardly enough to use; and that has led him into\\ncard-playing—Middlemarch is a great place for whist. He does play for\\nmoney, and he wins a good deal. Of course that takes him into company a\\nlittle beneath him, and makes him slack about some things; and yet,\\nwith all that, looking at him as a whole, I think he is one of the most\\nblameless men I ever knew. He has neither venom nor doubleness in him,\\nand those often go with a more correct outside.”\\n\\n“I wonder whether he suffers in his conscience because of that habit,”\\nsaid Dorothea; “I wonder whether he wishes he could leave it off.”\\n\\n“I have no doubt he would leave it off, if he were transplanted into\\nplenty: he would be glad of the time for other things.”\\n\\n“My uncle says that Mr. Tyke is spoken of as an apostolic man,” said\\nDorothea, meditatively. She was wishing it were possible to restore the\\ntimes of primitive zeal, and yet thinking of Mr. Farebrother with a\\nstrong desire to rescue him from his chance-gotten money.\\n\\n“I don’t pretend to say that Farebrother is apostolic,” said Lydgate.\\n“His position is not quite like that of the Apostles: he is only a\\nparson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.\\nPractically I find that what is called being apostolic now, is an\\nimpatience of everything in which the parson doesn’t cut the principal\\nfigure. I see something of that in Mr. Tyke at the Hospital: a good\\ndeal of his doctrine is a sort of pinching hard to make people\\nuncomfortably aware of him. Besides, an apostolic man at Lowick!—he\\nought to think, as St. Francis did, that it is needful to preach to the\\nbirds.”\\n\\n“True,” said Dorothea. “It is hard to imagine what sort of notions our\\nfarmers and laborers get from their teaching. I have been looking into\\na volume of sermons by Mr. Tyke: such sermons would be of no use at\\nLowick—I mean, about imputed righteousness and the prophecies in the\\nApocalypse. I have always been thinking of the different ways in which\\nChristianity is taught, and whenever I find one way that makes it a\\nwider blessing than any other, I cling to that as the truest—I mean\\nthat which takes in the most good of all kinds, and brings in the most\\npeople as sharers in it. It is surely better to pardon too much, than\\nto condemn too much. But I should like to see Mr. Farebrother and hear\\nhim preach.”\\n\\n“Do,” said Lydgate; “I trust to the effect of that. He is very much\\nbeloved, but he has his enemies too: there are always people who can’t\\nforgive an able man for differing from them. And that money-winning\\nbusiness is really a blot. You don’t, of course, see many Middlemarch\\npeople: but Mr. Ladislaw, who is constantly seeing Mr. Brooke, is a\\ngreat friend of Mr. Farebrother’s old ladies, and would be glad to sing\\nthe Vicar’s praises. One of the old ladies—Miss Noble, the aunt—is a\\nwonderfully quaint picture of self-forgetful goodness, and Ladislaw\\ngallants her about sometimes. I met them one day in a back street: you\\nknow Ladislaw’s look—a sort of Daphnis in coat and waistcoat; and this\\nlittle old maid reaching up to his arm—they looked like a couple\\ndropped out of a romantic comedy. But the best evidence about\\nFarebrother is to see him and hear him.”\\n\\nHappily Dorothea was in her private sitting-room when this conversation\\noccurred, and there was no one present to make Lydgate’s innocent\\nintroduction of Ladislaw painful to her. As was usual with him in\\nmatters of personal gossip, Lydgate had quite forgotten Rosamond’s\\nremark that she thought Will adored Mrs. Casaubon. At that moment he\\nwas only caring for what would recommend the Farebrother family; and he\\nhad purposely given emphasis to the worst that could be said about the\\nVicar, in order to forestall objections. In the weeks since Mr.\\nCasaubon’s death he had hardly seen Ladislaw, and he had heard no rumor\\nto warn him that Mr. Brooke’s confidential secretary was a dangerous\\nsubject with Mrs. Casaubon. When he was gone, his picture of Ladislaw\\nlingered in her mind and disputed the ground with that question of the\\nLowick living. What was Will Ladislaw thinking about her? Would he hear\\nof that fact which made her cheeks burn as they never used to do? And\\nhow would he feel when he heard it?—But she could see as well as\\npossible how he smiled down at the little old maid. An Italian with\\nwhite mice!—on the contrary, he was a creature who entered into every\\none’s feelings, and could take the pressure of their thought instead of\\nurging his own with iron resistance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LI.\\n\\nParty is Nature too, and you shall see\\nBy force of Logic how they both agree:\\nThe Many in the One, the One in Many;\\nAll is not Some, nor Some the same as Any:\\nGenus holds species, both are great or small;\\nOne genus highest, one not high at all;\\nEach species has its differentia too,\\nThis is not That, and He was never You,\\nThough this and that are AYES, and you and he\\nAre like as one to one, or three to three.\\n\\n\\nNo gossip about Mr. Casaubon’s will had yet reached Ladislaw: the air\\nseemed to be filled with the dissolution of Parliament and the coming\\nelection, as the old wakes and fairs were filled with the rival clatter\\nof itinerant shows; and more private noises were taken little notice\\nof. The famous “dry election” was at hand, in which the depths of\\npublic feeling might be measured by the low flood-mark of drink. Will\\nLadislaw was one of the busiest at this time; and though Dorothea’s\\nwidowhood was continually in his thought, he was so far from wishing to\\nbe spoken to on the subject, that when Lydgate sought him out to tell\\nhim what had passed about the Lowick living, he answered rather\\nwaspishly—\\n\\n“Why should you bring me into the matter? I never see Mrs. Casaubon,\\nand am not likely to see her, since she is at Freshitt. I never go\\nthere. It is Tory ground, where I and the ‘Pioneer’ are no more welcome\\nthan a poacher and his gun.”\\n\\nThe fact was that Will had been made the more susceptible by observing\\nthat Mr. Brooke, instead of wishing him, as before, to come to the\\nGrange oftener than was quite agreeable to himself, seemed now to\\ncontrive that he should go there as little as possible. This was a\\nshuffling concession of Mr. Brooke’s to Sir James Chettam’s indignant\\nremonstrance; and Will, awake to the slightest hint in this direction,\\nconcluded that he was to be kept away from the Grange on Dorothea’s\\naccount. Her friends, then, regarded him with some suspicion? Their\\nfears were quite superfluous: they were very much mistaken if they\\nimagined that he would put himself forward as a needy adventurer trying\\nto win the favor of a rich woman.\\n\\nUntil now Will had never fully seen the chasm between himself and\\nDorothea—until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on\\nthe other side. He began, not without some inward rage, to think of\\ngoing away from the neighborhood: it would be impossible for him to\\nshow any further interest in Dorothea without subjecting himself to\\ndisagreeable imputations—perhaps even in her mind, which others might\\ntry to poison.\\n\\n“We are forever divided,” said Will. “I might as well be at Rome; she\\nwould be no farther from me.” But what we call our despair is often\\nonly the painful eagerness of unfed hope. There were plenty of reasons\\nwhy he should not go—public reasons why he should not quit his post at\\nthis crisis, leaving Mr. Brooke in the lurch when he needed “coaching”\\nfor the election, and when there was so much canvassing, direct and\\nindirect, to be carried on. Will could not like to leave his own\\nchessmen in the heat of a game; and any candidate on the right side,\\neven if his brain and marrow had been as soft as was consistent with a\\ngentlemanly bearing, might help to turn a majority. To coach Mr. Brooke\\nand keep him steadily to the idea that he must pledge himself to vote\\nfor the actual Reform Bill, instead of insisting on his independence\\nand power of pulling up in time, was not an easy task. Mr.\\nFarebrother’s prophecy of a fourth candidate “in the bag” had not yet\\nbeen fulfilled, neither the Parliamentary Candidate Society nor any\\nother power on the watch to secure a reforming majority seeing a worthy\\nnodus for interference while there was a second reforming candidate\\nlike Mr. Brooke, who might be returned at his own expense; and the\\nfight lay entirely between Pinkerton the old Tory member, Bagster the\\nnew Whig member returned at the last election, and Brooke the future\\nindependent member, who was to fetter himself for this occasion only.\\nMr. Hawley and his party would bend all their forces to the return of\\nPinkerton, and Mr. Brooke’s success must depend either on plumpers\\nwhich would leave Bagster in the rear, or on the new minting of Tory\\nvotes into reforming votes. The latter means, of course, would be\\npreferable.\\n\\nThis prospect of converting votes was a dangerous distraction to Mr.\\nBrooke: his impression that waverers were likely to be allured by\\nwavering statements, and also the liability of his mind to stick afresh\\nat opposing arguments as they turned up in his memory, gave Will\\nLadislaw much trouble.\\n\\n“You know there are tactics in these things,” said Mr. Brooke; “meeting\\npeople half-way—tempering your ideas—saying, ‘Well now, there’s\\nsomething in that,’ and so on. I agree with you that this is a peculiar\\noccasion—the country with a will of its own—political unions—that sort\\nof thing—but we sometimes cut with rather too sharp a knife, Ladislaw.\\nThese ten-pound householders, now: why ten? Draw the line\\nsomewhere—yes: but why just at ten? That’s a difficult question, now,\\nif you go into it.”\\n\\n“Of course it is,” said Will, impatiently. “But if you are to wait till\\nwe get a logical Bill, you must put yourself forward as a\\nrevolutionist, and then Middlemarch would not elect you, I fancy. As\\nfor trimming, this is not a time for trimming.”\\n\\nMr. Brooke always ended by agreeing with Ladislaw, who still appeared\\nto him a sort of Burke with a leaven of Shelley; but after an interval\\nthe wisdom of his own methods reasserted itself, and he was again drawn\\ninto using them with much hopefulness. At this stage of affairs he was\\nin excellent spirits, which even supported him under large advances of\\nmoney; for his powers of convincing and persuading had not yet been\\ntested by anything more difficult than a chairman’s speech introducing\\nother orators, or a dialogue with a Middlemarch voter, from which he\\ncame away with a sense that he was a tactician by nature, and that it\\nwas a pity he had not gone earlier into this kind of thing. He was a\\nlittle conscious of defeat, however, with Mr. Mawmsey, a chief\\nrepresentative in Middlemarch of that great social power, the retail\\ntrader, and naturally one of the most doubtful voters in the\\nborough—willing for his own part to supply an equal quality of teas and\\nsugars to reformer and anti-reformer, as well as to agree impartially\\nwith both, and feeling like the burgesses of old that this necessity of\\nelecting members was a great burthen to a town; for even if there were\\nno danger in holding out hopes to all parties beforehand, there would\\nbe the painful necessity at last of disappointing respectable people\\nwhose names were on his books. He was accustomed to receive large\\norders from Mr. Brooke of Tipton; but then, there were many of\\nPinkerton’s committee whose opinions had a great weight of grocery on\\ntheir side. Mr. Mawmsey thinking that Mr. Brooke, as not too “clever in\\nhis intellects,” was the more likely to forgive a grocer who gave a\\nhostile vote under pressure, had become confidential in his back\\nparlor.\\n\\n“As to Reform, sir, put it in a family light,” he said, rattling the\\nsmall silver in his pocket, and smiling affably. “Will it support Mrs.\\nMawmsey, and enable her to bring up six children when I am no more? I\\nput the question _fictiously_, knowing what must be the answer. Very\\nwell, sir. I ask you what, as a husband and a father, I am to do when\\ngentlemen come to me and say, ‘Do as you like, Mawmsey; but if you vote\\nagainst us, I shall get my groceries elsewhere: when I sugar my liquor\\nI like to feel that I am benefiting the country by maintaining\\ntradesmen of the right color.’ Those very words have been spoken to me,\\nsir, in the very chair where you are now sitting. I don’t mean by your\\nhonorable self, Mr. Brooke.”\\n\\n“No, no, no—that’s narrow, you know. Until my butler complains to me of\\nyour goods, Mr. Mawmsey,” said Mr. Brooke, soothingly, “until I hear\\nthat you send bad sugars, spices—that sort of thing—I shall never order\\nhim to go elsewhere.”\\n\\n“Sir, I am your humble servant, and greatly obliged,” said Mr. Mawmsey,\\nfeeling that politics were clearing up a little. “There would be some\\npleasure in voting for a gentleman who speaks in that honorable\\nmanner.”\\n\\n“Well, you know, Mr. Mawmsey, you would find it the right thing to put\\nyourself on our side. This Reform will touch everybody by-and-by—a\\nthoroughly popular measure—a sort of A, B, C, you know, that must come\\nfirst before the rest can follow. I quite agree with you that you’ve\\ngot to look at the thing in a family light: but public spirit, now.\\nWe’re all one family, you know—it’s all one cupboard. Such a thing as a\\nvote, now: why, it may help to make men’s fortunes at the Cape—there’s\\nno knowing what may be the effect of a vote,” Mr. Brooke ended, with a\\nsense of being a little out at sea, though finding it still enjoyable.\\nBut Mr. Mawmsey answered in a tone of decisive check.\\n\\n“I beg your pardon, sir, but I can’t afford that. When I give a vote I\\nmust know what I am doing; I must look to what will be the effects on\\nmy till and ledger, speaking respectfully. Prices, I’ll admit, are what\\nnobody can know the merits of; and the sudden falls after you’ve bought\\nin currants, which are a goods that will not keep—I’ve never; myself\\nseen into the ins and outs there; which is a rebuke to human pride. But\\nas to one family, there’s debtor and creditor, I hope; they’re not\\ngoing to reform that away; else I should vote for things staying as\\nthey are. Few men have less need to cry for change than I have,\\npersonally speaking—that is, for self and family. I am not one of those\\nwho have nothing to lose: I mean as to respectability both in parish\\nand private business, and noways in respect of your honorable self and\\ncustom, which you was good enough to say you would not withdraw from\\nme, vote or no vote, while the article sent in was satisfactory.”\\n\\nAfter this conversation Mr. Mawmsey went up and boasted to his wife\\nthat he had been rather too many for Brooke of Tipton, and that he\\ndidn’t mind so much now about going to the poll.\\n\\nMr. Brooke on this occasion abstained from boasting of his tactics to\\nLadislaw, who for his part was glad enough to persuade himself that he\\nhad no concern with any canvassing except the purely argumentative\\nsort, and that he worked no meaner engine than knowledge. Mr. Brooke,\\nnecessarily, had his agents, who understood the nature of the\\nMiddlemarch voter and the means of enlisting his ignorance on the side\\nof the Bill—which were remarkably similar to the means of enlisting it\\non the side against the Bill. Will stopped his ears. Occasionally\\nParliament, like the rest of our lives, even to our eating and apparel,\\ncould hardly go on if our imaginations were too active about processes.\\nThere were plenty of dirty-handed men in the world to do dirty\\nbusiness; and Will protested to himself that his share in bringing Mr.\\nBrooke through would be quite innocent.\\n\\nBut whether he should succeed in that mode of contributing to the\\nmajority on the right side was very doubtful to him. He had written out\\nvarious speeches and memoranda for speeches, but he had begun to\\nperceive that Mr. Brooke’s mind, if it had the burthen of remembering\\nany train of thought, would let it drop, run away in search of it, and\\nnot easily come back again. To collect documents is one mode of serving\\nyour country, and to remember the contents of a document is another.\\nNo! the only way in which Mr. Brooke could be coerced into thinking of\\nthe right arguments at the right time was to be well plied with them\\ntill they took up all the room in his brain. But here there was the\\ndifficulty of finding room, so many things having been taken in\\nbeforehand. Mr. Brooke himself observed that his ideas stood rather in\\nhis way when he was speaking.\\n\\nHowever, Ladislaw’s coaching was forthwith to be put to the test, for\\nbefore the day of nomination Mr. Brooke was to explain himself to the\\nworthy electors of Middlemarch from the balcony of the White Hart,\\nwhich looked out advantageously at an angle of the market-place,\\ncommanding a large area in front and two converging streets. It was a\\nfine May morning, and everything seemed hopeful: there was some\\nprospect of an understanding between Bagster’s committee and Brooke’s,\\nto which Mr. Bulstrode, Mr. Standish as a Liberal lawyer, and such\\nmanufacturers as Mr. Plymdale and Mr. Vincy, gave a solidity which\\nalmost counterbalanced Mr. Hawley and his associates who sat for\\nPinkerton at the Green Dragon. Mr. Brooke, conscious of having weakened\\nthe blasts of the “Trumpet” against him, by his reforms as a landlord\\nin the last half year, and hearing himself cheered a little as he drove\\ninto the town, felt his heart tolerably light under his buff-colored\\nwaistcoat. But with regard to critical occasions, it often happens that\\nall moments seem comfortably remote until the last.\\n\\n“This looks well, eh?” said Mr. Brooke as the crowd gathered. “I shall\\nhave a good audience, at any rate. I like this, now—this kind of public\\nmade up of one’s own neighbors, you know.”\\n\\nThe weavers and tanners of Middlemarch, unlike Mr. Mawmsey, had never\\nthought of Mr. Brooke as a neighbor, and were not more attached to him\\nthan if he had been sent in a box from London. But they listened\\nwithout much disturbance to the speakers who introduced the candidate,\\none of them—a political personage from Brassing, who came to tell\\nMiddlemarch its duty—spoke so fully, that it was alarming to think what\\nthe candidate could find to say after him. Meanwhile the crowd became\\ndenser, and as the political personage neared the end of his speech,\\nMr. Brooke felt a remarkable change in his sensations while he still\\nhandled his eye-glass, trifled with documents before him, and exchanged\\nremarks with his committee, as a man to whom the moment of summons was\\nindifferent.\\n\\n“I’ll take another glass of sherry, Ladislaw,” he said, with an easy\\nair, to Will, who was close behind him, and presently handed him the\\nsupposed fortifier. It was ill-chosen; for Mr. Brooke was an abstemious\\nman, and to drink a second glass of sherry quickly at no great interval\\nfrom the first was a surprise to his system which tended to scatter his\\nenergies instead of collecting them. Pray pity him: so many English\\ngentlemen make themselves miserable by speechifying on entirely private\\ngrounds! whereas Mr. Brooke wished to serve his country by standing for\\nParliament—which, indeed, may also be done on private grounds, but\\nbeing once undertaken does absolutely demand some speechifying.\\n\\nIt was not about the beginning of his speech that Mr. Brooke was at all\\nanxious; this, he felt sure, would be all right; he should have it\\nquite pat, cut out as neatly as a set of couplets from Pope. Embarking\\nwould be easy, but the vision of open sea that might come after was\\nalarming. “And questions, now,” hinted the demon just waking up in his\\nstomach, “somebody may put questions about the schedules.—Ladislaw,” he\\ncontinued, aloud, “just hand me the memorandum of the schedules.”\\n\\nWhen Mr. Brooke presented himself on the balcony, the cheers were quite\\nloud enough to counterbalance the yells, groans, brayings, and other\\nexpressions of adverse theory, which were so moderate that Mr. Standish\\n(decidedly an old bird) observed in the ear next to him, “This looks\\ndangerous, by God! Hawley has got some deeper plan than this.” Still,\\nthe cheers were exhilarating, and no candidate could look more amiable\\nthan Mr. Brooke, with the memorandum in his breast-pocket, his left\\nhand on the rail of the balcony, and his right trifling with his\\neye-glass. The striking points in his appearance were his buff\\nwaistcoat, short-clipped blond hair, and neutral physiognomy. He began\\nwith some confidence.\\n\\n“Gentlemen—Electors of Middlemarch!”\\n\\nThis was so much the right thing that a little pause after it seemed\\nnatural.\\n\\n“I’m uncommonly glad to be here—I was never so proud and happy in my\\nlife—never so happy, you know.”\\n\\nThis was a bold figure of speech, but not exactly the right thing; for,\\nunhappily, the pat opening had slipped away—even couplets from Pope may\\nbe but “fallings from us, vanishings,” when fear clutches us, and a\\nglass of sherry is hurrying like smoke among our ideas. Ladislaw, who\\nstood at the window behind the speaker, thought, “it’s all up now. The\\nonly chance is that, since the best thing won’t always do, floundering\\nmay answer for once.” Mr. Brooke, meanwhile, having lost other clews,\\nfell back on himself and his qualifications—always an appropriate\\ngraceful subject for a candidate.\\n\\n“I am a close neighbor of yours, my good friends—you’ve known me on the\\nbench a good while—I’ve always gone a good deal into public\\nquestions—machinery, now, and machine-breaking—you’re many of you\\nconcerned with machinery, and I’ve been going into that lately. It\\nwon’t do, you know, breaking machines: everything must go on—trade,\\nmanufactures, commerce, interchange of staples—that kind of thing—since\\nAdam Smith, that must go on. We must look all over the\\nglobe:—‘Observation with extensive view,’ must look everywhere, ‘from\\nChina to Peru,’ as somebody says—Johnson, I think, ‘The Rambler,’ you\\nknow. That is what I have done up to a certain point—not as far as\\nPeru; but I’ve not always stayed at home—I saw it wouldn’t do. I’ve\\nbeen in the Levant, where some of your Middlemarch goods go—and then,\\nagain, in the Baltic. The Baltic, now.”\\n\\nPlying among his recollections in this way, Mr. Brooke might have got\\nalong, easily to himself, and would have come back from the remotest\\nseas without trouble; but a diabolical procedure had been set up by the\\nenemy. At one and the same moment there had risen above the shoulders\\nof the crowd, nearly opposite Mr. Brooke, and within ten yards of him,\\nthe effigy of himself: buff-colored waistcoat, eye-glass, and neutral\\nphysiognomy, painted on rag; and there had arisen, apparently in the\\nair, like the note of the cuckoo, a parrot-like, Punch-voiced echo of\\nhis words. Everybody looked up at the open windows in the houses at the\\nopposite angles of the converging streets; but they were either blank,\\nor filled by laughing listeners. The most innocent echo has an impish\\nmockery in it when it follows a gravely persistent speaker, and this\\necho was not at all innocent; if it did not follow with the precision\\nof a natural echo, it had a wicked choice of the words it overtook. By\\nthe time it said, “The Baltic, now,” the laugh which had been running\\nthrough the audience became a general shout, and but for the sobering\\neffects of party and that great public cause which the entanglement of\\nthings had identified with “Brooke of Tipton,” the laugh might have\\ncaught his committee. Mr. Bulstrode asked, reprehensively, what the new\\npolice was doing; but a voice could not well be collared, and an attack\\non the effigy of the candidate would have been too equivocal, since\\nHawley probably meant it to be pelted.\\n\\nMr. Brooke himself was not in a position to be quickly conscious of\\nanything except a general slipping away of ideas within himself: he had\\neven a little singing in the ears, and he was the only person who had\\nnot yet taken distinct account of the echo or discerned the image of\\nhimself. Few things hold the perceptions more thoroughly captive than\\nanxiety about what we have got to say. Mr. Brooke heard the laughter;\\nbut he had expected some Tory efforts at disturbance, and he was at\\nthis moment additionally excited by the tickling, stinging sense that\\nhis lost exordium was coming back to fetch him from the Baltic.\\n\\n“That reminds me,” he went on, thrusting a hand into his side-pocket,\\nwith an easy air, “if I wanted a precedent, you know—but we never want\\na precedent for the right thing—but there is Chatham, now; I can’t say\\nI should have supported Chatham, or Pitt, the younger Pitt—he was not a\\nman of ideas, and we want ideas, you know.”\\n\\n“Blast your ideas! we want the Bill,” said a loud rough voice from the\\ncrowd below.\\n\\nImmediately the invisible Punch, who had hitherto followed Mr. Brooke,\\nrepeated, “Blast your ideas! we want the Bill.” The laugh was louder\\nthan ever, and for the first time Mr. Brooke being himself silent,\\nheard distinctly the mocking echo. But it seemed to ridicule his\\ninterrupter, and in that light was encouraging; so he replied with\\namenity—\\n\\n“There is something in what you say, my good friend, and what do we\\nmeet for but to speak our minds—freedom of opinion, freedom of the\\npress, liberty—that kind of thing? The Bill, now—you shall have the\\nBill”—here Mr. Brooke paused a moment to fix on his eye-glass and take\\nthe paper from his breast-pocket, with a sense of being practical and\\ncoming to particulars. The invisible Punch followed:—\\n\\n“You shall have the Bill, Mr. Brooke, per electioneering contest, and a\\nseat outside Parliament as delivered, five thousand pounds, seven\\nshillings, and fourpence.”\\n\\nMr. Brooke, amid the roars of laughter, turned red, let his eye-glass\\nfall, and looking about him confusedly, saw the image of himself, which\\nhad come nearer. The next moment he saw it dolorously bespattered with\\neggs. His spirit rose a little, and his voice too.\\n\\n“Buffoonery, tricks, ridicule the test of truth—all that is very\\nwell”—here an unpleasant egg broke on Mr. Brooke’s shoulder, as the\\necho said, “All that is very well;” then came a hail of eggs, chiefly\\naimed at the image, but occasionally hitting the original, as if by\\nchance. There was a stream of new men pushing among the crowd;\\nwhistles, yells, bellowings, and fifes made all the greater hubbub\\nbecause there was shouting and struggling to put them down. No voice\\nwould have had wing enough to rise above the uproar, and Mr. Brooke,\\ndisagreeably anointed, stood his ground no longer. The frustration\\nwould have been less exasperating if it had been less gamesome and\\nboyish: a serious assault of which the newspaper reporter “can aver\\nthat it endangered the learned gentleman’s ribs,” or can respectfully\\nbear witness to “the soles of that gentleman’s boots having been\\nvisible above the railing,” has perhaps more consolations attached to\\nit.\\n\\nMr. Brooke re-entered the committee-room, saying, as carelessly as he\\ncould, “This is a little too bad, you know. I should have got the ear\\nof the people by-and-by—but they didn’t give me time. I should have\\ngone into the Bill by-and-by, you know,” he added, glancing at\\nLadislaw. “However, things will come all right at the nomination.”\\n\\nBut it was not resolved unanimously that things would come right; on\\nthe contrary, the committee looked rather grim, and the political\\npersonage from Brassing was writing busily, as if he were brewing new\\ndevices.\\n\\n“It was Bowyer who did it,” said Mr. Standish, evasively. “I know it as\\nwell as if he had been advertised. He’s uncommonly good at\\nventriloquism, and he did it uncommonly well, by God! Hawley has been\\nhaving him to dinner lately: there’s a fund of talent in Bowyer.”\\n\\n“Well, you know, you never mentioned him to me, Standish, else I would\\nhave invited him to dine,” said poor Mr. Brooke, who had gone through a\\ngreat deal of inviting for the good of his country.\\n\\n“There’s not a more paltry fellow in Middlemarch than Bowyer,” said\\nLadislaw, indignantly, “but it seems as if the paltry fellows were\\nalways to turn the scale.”\\n\\nWill was thoroughly out of temper with himself as well as with his\\n“principal,” and he went to shut himself in his rooms with a\\nhalf-formed resolve to throw up the “Pioneer” and Mr. Brooke together.\\nWhy should he stay? If the impassable gulf between himself and Dorothea\\nwere ever to be filled up, it must rather be by his going away and\\ngetting into a thoroughly different position than by staying here and\\nslipping into deserved contempt as an understrapper of Brooke’s. Then\\ncame the young dream of wonders that he might do—in five years, for\\nexample: political writing, political speaking, would get a higher\\nvalue now public life was going to be wider and more national, and they\\nmight give him such distinction that he would not seem to be asking\\nDorothea to step down to him. Five years:—if he could only be sure that\\nshe cared for him more than for others; if he could only make her aware\\nthat he stood aloof until he could tell his love without lowering\\nhimself—then he could go away easily, and begin a career which at\\nfive-and-twenty seemed probable enough in the inward order of things,\\nwhere talent brings fame, and fame everything else which is delightful.\\nHe could speak and he could write; he could master any subject if he\\nchose, and he meant always to take the side of reason and justice, on\\nwhich he would carry all his ardor. Why should he not one day be lifted\\nabove the shoulders of the crowd, and feel that he had won that\\neminence well? Without doubt he would leave Middlemarch, go to town,\\nand make himself fit for celebrity by “eating his dinners.”\\n\\nBut not immediately: not until some kind of sign had passed between him\\nand Dorothea. He could not be satisfied until she knew why, even if he\\nwere the man she would choose to marry, he would not marry her. Hence\\nhe must keep his post and bear with Mr. Brooke a little longer.\\n\\nBut he soon had reason to suspect that Mr. Brooke had anticipated him\\nin the wish to break up their connection. Deputations without and\\nvoices within had concurred in inducing that philanthropist to take a\\nstronger measure than usual for the good of mankind; namely, to\\nwithdraw in favor of another candidate, to whom he left the advantages\\nof his canvassing machinery. He himself called this a strong measure,\\nbut observed that his health was less capable of sustaining excitement\\nthan he had imagined.\\n\\n“I have felt uneasy about the chest—it won’t do to carry that too far,”\\nhe said to Ladislaw in explaining the affair. “I must pull up. Poor\\nCasaubon was a warning, you know. I’ve made some heavy advances, but\\nI’ve dug a channel. It’s rather coarse work—this electioneering, eh,\\nLadislaw? dare say you are tired of it. However, we have dug a channel\\nwith the ‘Pioneer’—put things in a track, and so on. A more ordinary\\nman than you might carry it on now—more ordinary, you know.”\\n\\n“Do you wish me to give it up?” said Will, the quick color coming in\\nhis face, as he rose from the writing-table, and took a turn of three\\nsteps with his hands in his pockets. “I am ready to do so whenever you\\nwish it.”\\n\\n“As to wishing, my dear Ladislaw, I have the highest opinion of your\\npowers, you know. But about the ‘Pioneer,’ I have been consulting a\\nlittle with some of the men on our side, and they are inclined to take\\nit into their hands—indemnify me to a certain extent—carry it on, in\\nfact. And under the circumstances, you might like to give up—might find\\na better field. These people might not take that high view of you which\\nI have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand—though I always\\nlooked forward to your doing something else. I think of having a run\\ninto France. But I’ll write you any letters, you know—to Althorpe and\\npeople of that kind. I’ve met Althorpe.”\\n\\n“I am exceedingly obliged to you,” said Ladislaw, proudly. “Since you\\nare going to part with the ‘Pioneer,’ I need not trouble you about the\\nsteps I shall take. I may choose to continue here for the present.”\\n\\nAfter Mr. Brooke had left him Will said to himself, “The rest of the\\nfamily have been urging him to get rid of me, and he doesn’t care now\\nabout my going. I shall stay as long as I like. I shall go of my own\\nmovements and not because they are afraid of me.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LII.\\n\\n“His heart\\nThe lowliest duties on itself did lay.”\\n—WORDSWORTH.\\n\\n\\nOn that June evening when Mr. Farebrother knew that he was to have the\\nLowick living, there was joy in the old fashioned parlor, and even the\\nportraits of the great lawyers seemed to look on with satisfaction. His\\nmother left her tea and toast untouched, but sat with her usual pretty\\nprimness, only showing her emotion by that flush in the cheeks and\\nbrightness in the eyes which give an old woman a touching momentary\\nidentity with her far-off youthful self, and saying decisively—\\n\\n“The greatest comfort, Camden, is that you have deserved it.”\\n\\n“When a man gets a good berth, mother, half the deserving must come\\nafter,” said the son, brimful of pleasure, and not trying to conceal\\nit. The gladness in his face was of that active kind which seems to\\nhave energy enough not only to flash outwardly, but to light up busy\\nvision within: one seemed to see thoughts, as well as delight, in his\\nglances.\\n\\n“Now, aunt,” he went on, rubbing his hands and looking at Miss Noble,\\nwho was making tender little beaver-like noises, “There shall be\\nsugar-candy always on the table for you to steal and give to the\\nchildren, and you shall have a great many new stockings to make\\npresents of, and you shall darn your own more than ever!”\\n\\nMiss Noble nodded at her nephew with a subdued half-frightened laugh,\\nconscious of having already dropped an additional lump of sugar into\\nher basket on the strength of the new preferment.\\n\\n“As for you, Winny”—the Vicar went on—“I shall make no difficulty about\\nyour marrying any Lowick bachelor—Mr. Solomon Featherstone, for\\nexample, as soon as I find you are in love with him.”\\n\\nMiss Winifred, who had been looking at her brother all the while and\\ncrying heartily, which was her way of rejoicing, smiled through her\\ntears and said, “You must set me the example, Cam: _you_ must marry\\nnow.”\\n\\n“With all my heart. But who is in love with me? I am a seedy old\\nfellow,” said the Vicar, rising, pushing his chair away and looking\\ndown at himself. “What do you say, mother?”\\n\\n“You are a handsome man, Camden: though not so fine a figure of a man\\nas your father,” said the old lady.\\n\\n“I wish you would marry Miss Garth, brother,” said Miss Winifred. “She\\nwould make us so lively at Lowick.”\\n\\n“Very fine! You talk as if young women were tied up to be chosen, like\\npoultry at market; as if I had only to ask and everybody would have\\nme,” said the Vicar, not caring to specify.\\n\\n“We don’t want everybody,” said Miss Winifred. “But _you_ would like\\nMiss Garth, mother, shouldn’t you?”\\n\\n“My son’s choice shall be mine,” said Mrs. Farebrother, with majestic\\ndiscretion, “and a wife would be most welcome, Camden. You will want\\nyour whist at home when we go to Lowick, and Henrietta Noble never was\\na whist-player.” (Mrs. Farebrother always called her tiny old sister by\\nthat magnificent name.)\\n\\n“I shall do without whist now, mother.”\\n\\n“Why so, Camden? In my time whist was thought an undeniable amusement\\nfor a good churchman,” said Mrs. Farebrother, innocent of the meaning\\nthat whist had for her son, and speaking rather sharply, as at some\\ndangerous countenancing of new doctrine.\\n\\n“I shall be too busy for whist; I shall have two parishes,” said the\\nVicar, preferring not to discuss the virtues of that game.\\n\\nHe had already said to Dorothea, “I don’t feel bound to give up St.\\nBotolph’s. It is protest enough against the pluralism they want to\\nreform if I give somebody else most of the money. The stronger thing is\\nnot to give up power, but to use it well.”\\n\\n“I have thought of that,” said Dorothea. “So far as self is concerned,\\nI think it would be easier to give up power and money than to keep\\nthem. It seems very unfitting that I should have this patronage, yet I\\nfelt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of\\nme.”\\n\\n“It is I who am bound to act so that you will not regret your power,”\\nsaid Mr. Farebrother.\\n\\nHis was one of the natures in which conscience gets the more active\\nwhen the yoke of life ceases to gall them. He made no display of\\nhumility on the subject, but in his heart he felt rather ashamed that\\nhis conduct had shown laches which others who did not get benefices\\nwere free from.\\n\\n“I used often to wish I had been something else than a clergyman,” he\\nsaid to Lydgate, “but perhaps it will be better to try and make as good\\na clergyman out of myself as I can. That is the well-beneficed point of\\nview, you perceive, from which difficulties are much simplified,” he\\nended, smiling.\\n\\nThe Vicar did feel then as if his share of duties would be easy. But\\nDuty has a trick of behaving unexpectedly—something like a heavy friend\\nwhom we have amiably asked to visit us, and who breaks his leg within\\nour gates.\\n\\nHardly a week later, Duty presented itself in his study under the\\ndisguise of Fred Vincy, now returned from Omnibus College with his\\nbachelor’s degree.\\n\\n“I am ashamed to trouble you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Fred, whose fair\\nopen face was propitiating, “but you are the only friend I can consult.\\nI told you everything once before, and you were so good that I can’t\\nhelp coming to you again.”\\n\\n“Sit down, Fred, I’m ready to hear and do anything I can,” said the\\nVicar, who was busy packing some small objects for removal, and went on\\nwith his work.\\n\\n“I wanted to tell you—” Fred hesitated an instant and then went on\\nplungingly, “I might go into the Church now; and really, look where I\\nmay, I can’t see anything else to do. I don’t like it, but I know it’s\\nuncommonly hard on my father to say so, after he has spent a good deal\\nof money in educating me for it.” Fred paused again an instant, and\\nthen repeated, “and I can’t see anything else to do.”\\n\\n“I did talk to your father about it, Fred, but I made little way with\\nhim. He said it was too late. But you have got over one bridge now:\\nwhat are your other difficulties?”\\n\\n“Merely that I don’t like it. I don’t like divinity, and preaching, and\\nfeeling obliged to look serious. I like riding across country, and\\ndoing as other men do. I don’t mean that I want to be a bad fellow in\\nany way; but I’ve no taste for the sort of thing people expect of a\\nclergyman. And yet what else am I to do? My father can’t spare me any\\ncapital, else I might go into farming. And he has no room for me in his\\ntrade. And of course I can’t begin to study for law or physic now, when\\nmy father wants me to earn something. It’s all very well to say I’m\\nwrong to go into the Church; but those who say so might as well tell me\\nto go into the backwoods.”\\n\\nFred’s voice had taken a tone of grumbling remonstrance, and Mr.\\nFarebrother might have been inclined to smile if his mind had not been\\ntoo busy in imagining more than Fred told him.\\n\\n“Have you any difficulties about doctrines—about the Articles?” he\\nsaid, trying hard to think of the question simply for Fred’s sake.\\n\\n“No; I suppose the Articles are right. I am not prepared with any\\narguments to disprove them, and much better, cleverer fellows than I am\\ngo in for them entirely. I think it would be rather ridiculous in me to\\nurge scruples of that sort, as if I were a judge,” said Fred, quite\\nsimply.\\n\\n“I suppose, then, it has occurred to you that you might be a fair\\nparish priest without being much of a divine?”\\n\\n“Of course, if I am obliged to be a clergyman, I shall try and do my\\nduty, though I mayn’t like it. Do you think any body ought to blame\\nme?”\\n\\n“For going into the Church under the circumstances? That depends on\\nyour conscience, Fred—how far you have counted the cost, and seen what\\nyour position will require of you. I can only tell you about myself,\\nthat I have always been too lax, and have been uneasy in consequence.”\\n\\n“But there is another hindrance,” said Fred, coloring. “I did not tell\\nyou before, though perhaps I may have said things that made you guess\\nit. There is somebody I am very fond of: I have loved her ever since we\\nwere children.”\\n\\n“Miss Garth, I suppose?” said the Vicar, examining some labels very\\nclosely.\\n\\n“Yes. I shouldn’t mind anything if she would have me. And I know I\\ncould be a good fellow then.”\\n\\n“And you think she returns the feeling?”\\n\\n“She never will say so; and a good while ago she made me promise not to\\nspeak to her about it again. And she has set her mind especially\\nagainst my being a clergyman; I know that. But I can’t give her up. I\\ndo think she cares about me. I saw Mrs. Garth last night, and she said\\nthat Mary was staying at Lowick Rectory with Miss Farebrother.”\\n\\n“Yes, she is very kindly helping my sister. Do you wish to go there?”\\n\\n“No, I want to ask a great favor of you. I am ashamed to bother you in\\nthis way; but Mary might listen to what you said, if you mentioned the\\nsubject to her—I mean about my going into the Church.”\\n\\n“That is rather a delicate task, my dear Fred. I shall have to\\npresuppose your attachment to her; and to enter on the subject as you\\nwish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.”\\n\\n“That is what I want her to tell you,” said Fred, bluntly. “I don’t\\nknow what to do, unless I can get at her feeling.”\\n\\n“You mean that you would be guided by that as to your going into the\\nChurch?”\\n\\n“If Mary said she would never have me I might as well go wrong in one\\nway as another.”\\n\\n“That is nonsense, Fred. Men outlive their love, but they don’t outlive\\nthe consequences of their recklessness.”\\n\\n“Not my sort of love: I have never been without loving Mary. If I had\\nto give her up, it would be like beginning to live on wooden legs.”\\n\\n“Will she not be hurt at my intrusion?”\\n\\n“No, I feel sure she will not. She respects you more than any one, and\\nshe would not put you off with fun as she does me. Of course I could\\nnot have told any one else, or asked any one else to speak to her, but\\nyou. There is no one else who could be such a friend to both of us.”\\nFred paused a moment, and then said, rather complainingly, “And she\\nought to acknowledge that I have worked in order to pass. She ought to\\nbelieve that I would exert myself for her sake.”\\n\\nThere was a moment’s silence before Mr. Farebrother laid down his work,\\nand putting out his hand to Fred said—\\n\\n“Very well, my boy. I will do what you wish.”\\n\\nThat very day Mr. Farebrother went to Lowick parsonage on the nag which\\nhe had just set up. “Decidedly I am an old stalk,” he thought, “the\\nyoung growths are pushing me aside.”\\n\\nHe found Mary in the garden gathering roses and sprinkling the petals\\non a sheet. The sun was low, and tall trees sent their shadows across\\nthe grassy walks where Mary was moving without bonnet or parasol. She\\ndid not observe Mr. Farebrother’s approach along the grass, and had\\njust stooped down to lecture a small black-and-tan terrier, which would\\npersist in walking on the sheet and smelling at the rose-leaves as Mary\\nsprinkled them. She took his fore-paws in one hand, and lifted up the\\nforefinger of the other, while the dog wrinkled his brows and looked\\nembarrassed. “Fly, Fly, I am ashamed of you,” Mary was saying in a\\ngrave contralto. “This is not becoming in a sensible dog; anybody would\\nthink you were a silly young gentleman.”\\n\\n“You are unmerciful to young gentlemen, Miss Garth,” said the Vicar,\\nwithin two yards of her.\\n\\nMary started up and blushed. “It always answers to reason with Fly,”\\nshe said, laughingly.\\n\\n“But not with young gentlemen?”\\n\\n“Oh, with some, I suppose; since some of them turn into excellent men.”\\n\\n“I am glad of that admission, because I want at this very moment to\\ninterest you in a young gentleman.”\\n\\n“Not a silly one, I hope,” said Mary, beginning to pluck the roses\\nagain, and feeling her heart beat uncomfortably.\\n\\n“No; though perhaps wisdom is not his strong point, but rather\\naffection and sincerity. However, wisdom lies more in those two\\nqualities than people are apt to imagine. I hope you know by those\\nmarks what young gentleman I mean.”\\n\\n“Yes, I think I do,” said Mary, bravely, her face getting more serious,\\nand her hands cold; “it must be Fred Vincy.”\\n\\n“He has asked me to consult you about his going into the Church. I hope\\nyou will not think that I consented to take a liberty in promising to\\ndo so.”\\n\\n“On the contrary, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, giving up the roses, and\\nfolding her arms, but unable to look up, “whenever you have anything to\\nsay to me I feel honored.”\\n\\n“But before I enter on that question, let me just touch a point on\\nwhich your father took me into confidence; by the way, it was that very\\nevening on which I once before fulfilled a mission from Fred, just\\nafter he had gone to college. Mr. Garth told me what happened on the\\nnight of Featherstone’s death—how you refused to burn the will; and he\\nsaid that you had some heart-prickings on that subject, because you had\\nbeen the innocent means of hindering Fred from getting his ten thousand\\npounds. I have kept that in mind, and I have heard something that may\\nrelieve you on that score—may show you that no sin-offering is demanded\\nfrom you there.”\\n\\nMr. Farebrother paused a moment and looked at Mary. He meant to give\\nFred his full advantage, but it would be well, he thought, to clear her\\nmind of any superstitions, such as women sometimes follow when they do\\na man the wrong of marrying him as an act of atonement. Mary’s cheeks\\nhad begun to burn a little, and she was mute.\\n\\n“I mean, that your action made no real difference to Fred’s lot. I find\\nthat the first will would not have been legally good after the burning\\nof the last; it would not have stood if it had been disputed, and you\\nmay be sure it would have been disputed. So, on that score, you may\\nfeel your mind free.”\\n\\n“Thank you, Mr. Farebrother,” said Mary, earnestly. “I am grateful to\\nyou for remembering my feelings.”\\n\\n“Well, now I may go on. Fred, you know, has taken his degree. He has\\nworked his way so far, and now the question is, what is he to do? That\\nquestion is so difficult that he is inclined to follow his father’s\\nwishes and enter the Church, though you know better than I do that he\\nwas quite set against that formerly. I have questioned him on the\\nsubject, and I confess I see no insuperable objection to his being a\\nclergyman, as things go. He says that he could turn his mind to doing\\nhis best in that vocation, on one condition. If that condition were\\nfulfilled I would do my utmost in helping Fred on. After a time—not, of\\ncourse, at first—he might be with me as my curate, and he would have so\\nmuch to do that his stipend would be nearly what I used to get as\\nvicar. But I repeat that there is a condition without which all this\\ngood cannot come to pass. He has opened his heart to me, Miss Garth,\\nand asked me to plead for him. The condition lies entirely in your\\nfeeling.”\\n\\nMary looked so much moved, that he said after a moment, “Let us walk a\\nlittle;” and when they were walking he added, “To speak quite plainly,\\nFred will not take any course which would lessen the chance that you\\nwould consent to be his wife; but with that prospect, he will try his\\nbest at anything you approve.”\\n\\n“I cannot possibly say that I will ever be his wife, Mr. Farebrother:\\nbut I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman. What\\nyou say is most generous and kind; I don’t mean for a moment to correct\\nyour judgment. It is only that I have my girlish, mocking way of\\nlooking at things,” said Mary, with a returning sparkle of playfulness\\nin her answer which only made its modesty more charming.\\n\\n“He wishes me to report exactly what you think,” said Mr. Farebrother.\\n\\n“I could not love a man who is ridiculous,” said Mary, not choosing to\\ngo deeper. “Fred has sense and knowledge enough to make him\\nrespectable, if he likes, in some good worldly business, but I can\\nnever imagine him preaching and exhorting, and pronouncing blessings,\\nand praying by the sick, without feeling as if I were looking at a\\ncaricature. His being a clergyman would be only for gentility’s sake,\\nand I think there is nothing more contemptible than such imbecile\\ngentility. I used to think that of Mr. Crowse, with his empty face and\\nneat umbrella, and mincing little speeches. What right have such men to\\nrepresent Christianity—as if it were an institution for getting up\\nidiots genteelly—as if—” Mary checked herself. She had been carried\\nalong as if she had been speaking to Fred instead of Mr. Farebrother.\\n\\n“Young women are severe: they don’t feel the stress of action as men\\ndo, though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there. But you\\ndon’t put Fred Vincy on so low a level as that?”\\n\\n“No, indeed, he has plenty of sense, but I think he would not show it\\nas a clergyman. He would be a piece of professional affectation.”\\n\\n“Then the answer is quite decided. As a clergyman he could have no\\nhope?”\\n\\nMary shook her head.\\n\\n“But if he braved all the difficulties of getting his bread in some\\nother way—will you give him the support of hope? May he count on\\nwinning you?”\\n\\n“I think Fred ought not to need telling again what I have already said\\nto him,” Mary answered, with a slight resentment in her manner. “I mean\\nthat he ought not to put such questions until he has done something\\nworthy, instead of saying that he could do it.”\\n\\nMr. Farebrother was silent for a minute or more, and then, as they\\nturned and paused under the shadow of a maple at the end of a grassy\\nwalk, said, “I understand that you resist any attempt to fetter you,\\nbut either your feeling for Fred Vincy excludes your entertaining\\nanother attachment, or it does not: either he may count on your\\nremaining single until he shall have earned your hand, or he may in any\\ncase be disappointed. Pardon me, Mary—you know I used to catechise you\\nunder that name—but when the state of a woman’s affections touches the\\nhappiness of another life—of more lives than one—I think it would be\\nthe nobler course for her to be perfectly direct and open.”\\n\\nMary in her turn was silent, wondering not at Mr. Farebrother’s manner\\nbut at his tone, which had a grave restrained emotion in it. When the\\nstrange idea flashed across her that his words had reference to\\nhimself, she was incredulous, and ashamed of entertaining it. She had\\nnever thought that any man could love her except Fred, who had espoused\\nher with the umbrella ring, when she wore socks and little strapped\\nshoes; still less that she could be of any importance to Mr.\\nFarebrother, the cleverest man in her narrow circle. She had only time\\nto feel that all this was hazy and perhaps illusory; but one thing was\\nclear and determined—her answer.\\n\\n“Since you think it my duty, Mr. Farebrother, I will tell you that I\\nhave too strong a feeling for Fred to give him up for any one else. I\\nshould never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of\\nme. It has taken such deep root in me—my gratitude to him for always\\nloving me best, and minding so much if I hurt myself, from the time\\nwhen we were very little. I cannot imagine any new feeling coming to\\nmake that weaker. I should like better than anything to see him worthy\\nof every one’s respect. But please tell him I will not promise to marry\\nhim till then: I should shame and grieve my father and mother. He is\\nfree to choose some one else.”\\n\\n“Then I have fulfilled my commission thoroughly,” said Mr. Farebrother,\\nputting out his hand to Mary, “and I shall ride back to Middlemarch\\nforthwith. With this prospect before him, we shall get Fred into the\\nright niche somehow, and I hope I shall live to join your hands. God\\nbless you!”\\n\\n“Oh, please stay, and let me give you some tea,” said Mary. Her eyes\\nfilled with tears, for something indefinable, something like the\\nresolute suppression of a pain in Mr. Farebrother’s manner, made her\\nfeel suddenly miserable, as she had once felt when she saw her father’s\\nhands trembling in a moment of trouble.\\n\\n“No, my dear, no. I must get back.”\\n\\nIn three minutes the Vicar was on horseback again, having gone\\nmagnanimously through a duty much harder than the renunciation of\\nwhist, or even than the writing of penitential meditations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIII.\\n\\nIt is but a shallow haste which concludeth insincerity from what\\noutsiders call inconsistency—putting a dead mechanism of “ifs” and\\n“therefores” for the living myriad of hidden suckers whereby the belief\\nand the conduct are wrought into mutual sustainment.\\n\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode, when he was hoping to acquire a new interest in Lowick,\\nhad naturally had an especial wish that the new clergyman should be one\\nwhom he thoroughly approved; and he believed it to be a chastisement\\nand admonition directed to his own shortcomings and those of the nation\\nat large, that just about the time when he came in possession of the\\ndeeds which made him the proprietor of Stone Court, Mr. Farebrother\\n“read himself” into the quaint little church and preached his first\\nsermon to the congregation of farmers, laborers, and village artisans.\\nIt was not that Mr. Bulstrode intended to frequent Lowick Church or to\\nreside at Stone Court for a good while to come: he had bought the\\nexcellent farm and fine homestead simply as a retreat which he might\\ngradually enlarge as to the land and beautify as to the dwelling, until\\nit should be conducive to the divine glory that he should enter on it\\nas a residence, partially withdrawing from his present exertions in the\\nadministration of business, and throwing more conspicuously on the side\\nof Gospel truth the weight of local landed proprietorship, which\\nProvidence might increase by unforeseen occasions of purchase. A strong\\nleading in this direction seemed to have been given in the surprising\\nfacility of getting Stone Court, when every one had expected that Mr.\\nRigg Featherstone would have clung to it as the Garden of Eden. That\\nwas what poor old Peter himself had expected; having often, in\\nimagination, looked up through the sods above him, and, unobstructed by\\nperspective, seen his frog-faced legatee enjoying the fine old place to\\nthe perpetual surprise and disappointment of other survivors.\\n\\nBut how little we know what would make paradise for our neighbors! We\\njudge from our own desires, and our neighbors themselves are not always\\nopen enough even to throw out a hint of theirs. The cool and judicious\\nJoshua Rigg had not allowed his parent to perceive that Stone Court was\\nanything less than the chief good in his estimation, and he had\\ncertainly wished to call it his own. But as Warren Hastings looked at\\ngold and thought of buying Daylesford, so Joshua Rigg looked at Stone\\nCourt and thought of buying gold. He had a very distinct and intense\\nvision of his chief good, the vigorous greed which he had inherited\\nhaving taken a special form by dint of circumstance: and his chief good\\nwas to be a moneychanger. From his earliest employment as an errand-boy\\nin a seaport, he had looked through the windows of the moneychangers as\\nother boys look through the windows of the pastry-cooks; the\\nfascination had wrought itself gradually into a deep special passion;\\nhe meant, when he had property, to do many things, one of them being to\\nmarry a genteel young person; but these were all accidents and joys\\nthat imagination could dispense with. The one joy after which his soul\\nthirsted was to have a money-changer’s shop on a much-frequented quay,\\nto have locks all round him of which he held the keys, and to look\\nsublimely cool as he handled the breeding coins of all nations, while\\nhelpless Cupidity looked at him enviously from the other side of an\\niron lattice. The strength of that passion had been a power enabling\\nhim to master all the knowledge necessary to gratify it. And when\\nothers were thinking that he had settled at Stone Court for life,\\nJoshua himself was thinking that the moment now was not far off when he\\nshould settle on the North Quay with the best appointments in safes and\\nlocks.\\n\\nEnough. We are concerned with looking at Joshua Rigg’s sale of his land\\nfrom Mr. Bulstrode’s point of view, and he interpreted it as a cheering\\ndispensation conveying perhaps a sanction to a purpose which he had for\\nsome time entertained without external encouragement; he interpreted it\\nthus, but not too confidently, offering up his thanksgiving in guarded\\nphraseology. His doubts did not arise from the possible relations of\\nthe event to Joshua Rigg’s destiny, which belonged to the unmapped\\nregions not taken under the providential government, except perhaps in\\nan imperfect colonial way; but they arose from reflecting that this\\ndispensation too might be a chastisement for himself, as Mr.\\nFarebrother’s induction to the living clearly was.\\n\\nThis was not what Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for the sake of\\ndeceiving him: it was what he said to himself—it was as genuinely his\\nmode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen\\nto disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories\\ndoes not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is\\nsatisfied, the more robust is our belief.\\n\\nHowever, whether for sanction or for chastisement, Mr. Bulstrode,\\nhardly fifteen months after the death of Peter Featherstone, had become\\nthe proprietor of Stone Court, and what Peter would say “if he were\\nworthy to know,” had become an inexhaustible and consolatory subject of\\nconversation to his disappointed relatives. The tables were now turned\\non that dear brother departed, and to contemplate the frustration of\\nhis cunning by the superior cunning of things in general was a cud of\\ndelight to Solomon. Mrs. Waule had a melancholy triumph in the proof\\nthat it did not answer to make false Featherstones and cut off the\\ngenuine; and Sister Martha receiving the news in the Chalky Flats said,\\n“Dear, dear! then the Almighty could have been none so pleased with the\\nalmshouses after all.”\\n\\nAffectionate Mrs. Bulstrode was particularly glad of the advantage\\nwhich her husband’s health was likely to get from the purchase of Stone\\nCourt. Few days passed without his riding thither and looking over some\\npart of the farm with the bailiff, and the evenings were delicious in\\nthat quiet spot, when the new hay-ricks lately set up were sending\\nforth odors to mingle with the breath of the rich old garden. One\\nevening, while the sun was still above the horizon and burning in\\ngolden lamps among the great walnut boughs, Mr. Bulstrode was pausing\\non horseback outside the front gate waiting for Caleb Garth, who had\\nmet him by appointment to give an opinion on a question of stable\\ndrainage, and was now advising the bailiff in the rick-yard.\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode was conscious of being in a good spiritual frame and more\\nthan usually serene, under the influence of his innocent recreation. He\\nwas doctrinally convinced that there was a total absence of merit in\\nhimself; but that doctrinal conviction may be held without pain when\\nthe sense of demerit does not take a distinct shape in memory and\\nrevive the tingling of shame or the pang of remorse. Nay, it may be\\nheld with intense satisfaction when the depth of our sinning is but a\\nmeasure for the depth of forgiveness, and a clenching proof that we are\\npeculiar instruments of the divine intention. The memory has as many\\nmoods as the temper, and shifts its scenery like a diorama. At this\\nmoment Mr. Bulstrode felt as if the sunshine were all one with that of\\nfar-off evenings when he was a very young man and used to go out\\npreaching beyond Highbury. And he would willingly have had that service\\nof exhortation in prospect now. The texts were there still, and so was\\nhis own facility in expounding them. His brief reverie was interrupted\\nby the return of Caleb Garth, who also was on horseback, and was just\\nshaking his bridle before starting, when he exclaimed—\\n\\n“Bless my heart! what’s this fellow in black coming along the lane?\\nHe’s like one of those men one sees about after the races.”\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode turned his horse and looked along the lane, but made no\\nreply. The comer was our slight acquaintance Mr. Raffles, whose\\nappearance presented no other change than such as was due to a suit of\\nblack and a crape hat-band. He was within three yards of the horseman\\nnow, and they could see the flash of recognition in his face as he\\nwhirled his stick upward, looking all the while at Mr. Bulstrode, and\\nat last exclaiming:—\\n\\n“By Jove, Nick, it’s you! I couldn’t be mistaken, though the\\nfive-and-twenty years have played old Boguy with us both! How are you,\\neh? you didn’t expect to see _me_ here. Come, shake us by the hand.” To\\nsay that Mr. Raffles’ manner was rather excited would be only one mode\\nof saying that it was evening. Caleb Garth could see that there was a\\nmoment of struggle and hesitation in Mr. Bulstrode, but it ended in his\\nputting out his hand coldly to Raffles and saying—\\n\\n“I did not indeed expect to see you in this remote country place.”\\n\\n“Well, it belongs to a stepson of mine,” said Raffles, adjusting\\nhimself in a swaggering attitude. “I came to see him here before. I’m\\nnot so surprised at seeing you, old fellow, because I picked up a\\nletter—what you may call a providential thing. It’s uncommonly\\nfortunate I met you, though; for I don’t care about seeing my stepson:\\nhe’s not affectionate, and his poor mother’s gone now. To tell the\\ntruth, I came out of love to you, Nick: I came to get your address,\\nfor—look here!” Raffles drew a crumpled paper from his pocket.\\n\\nAlmost any other man than Caleb Garth might have been tempted to linger\\non the spot for the sake of hearing all he could about a man whose\\nacquaintance with Bulstrode seemed to imply passages in the banker’s\\nlife so unlike anything that was known of him in Middlemarch that they\\nmust have the nature of a secret to pique curiosity. But Caleb was\\npeculiar: certain human tendencies which are commonly strong were\\nalmost absent from his mind; and one of these was curiosity about\\npersonal affairs. Especially if there was anything discreditable to be\\nfound out concerning another man, Caleb preferred not to know it; and\\nif he had to tell anybody under him that his evil doings were\\ndiscovered, he was more embarrassed than the culprit. He now spurred\\nhis horse, and saying, “I wish you good evening, Mr. Bulstrode; I must\\nbe getting home,” set off at a trot.\\n\\n“You didn’t put your full address to this letter,” Raffles continued.\\n“That was not like the first-rate man of business you used to be. ‘The\\nShrubs,’—they may be anywhere: you live near at hand, eh?—have cut the\\nLondon concern altogether—perhaps turned country squire—have a rural\\nmansion to invite me to. Lord, how many years it is ago! The old lady\\nmust have been dead a pretty long while—gone to glory without the pain\\nof knowing how poor her daughter was, eh? But, by Jove! you’re very\\npale and pasty, Nick. Come, if you’re going home, I’ll walk by your\\nside.”\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode’s usual paleness had in fact taken an almost deathly hue.\\nFive minutes before, the expanse of his life had been submerged in its\\nevening sunshine which shone backward to its remembered morning: sin\\nseemed to be a question of doctrine and inward penitence, humiliation\\nan exercise of the closet, the bearing of his deeds a matter of private\\nvision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the\\ndivine purposes. And now, as if by some hideous magic, this loud red\\nfigure had risen before him in unmanageable solidity—an incorporate\\npast which had not entered into his imagination of chastisements. But\\nMr. Bulstrode’s thought was busy, and he was not a man to act or speak\\nrashly.\\n\\n“I was going home,” he said, “but I can defer my ride a little. And you\\ncan, if you please, rest here.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” said Raffles, making a grimace. “I don’t care now about\\nseeing my stepson. I’d rather go home with you.”\\n\\n“Your stepson, if Mr. Rigg Featherstone was he, is here no longer. I am\\nmaster here now.”\\n\\nRaffles opened wide eyes, and gave a long whistle of surprise, before\\nhe said, “Well then, I’ve no objection. I’ve had enough walking from\\nthe coach-road. I never was much of a walker, or rider either. What I\\nlike is a smart vehicle and a spirited cob. I was always a little heavy\\nin the saddle. What a pleasant surprise it must be to you to see me,\\nold fellow!” he continued, as they turned towards the house. “You don’t\\nsay so; but you never took your luck heartily—you were always thinking\\nof improving the occasion—you’d such a gift for improving your luck.”\\n\\nMr. Raffles seemed greatly to enjoy his own wit, and swung his leg in a\\nswaggering manner which was rather too much for his companion’s\\njudicious patience.\\n\\n“If I remember rightly,” Mr. Bulstrode observed, with chill anger, “our\\nacquaintance many years ago had not the sort of intimacy which you are\\nnow assuming, Mr. Raffles. Any services you desire of me will be the\\nmore readily rendered if you will avoid a tone of familiarity which did\\nnot lie in our former intercourse, and can hardly be warranted by more\\nthan twenty years of separation.”\\n\\n“You don’t like being called Nick? Why, I always called you Nick in my\\nheart, and though lost to sight, to memory dear. By Jove! my feelings\\nhave ripened for you like fine old cognac. I hope you’ve got some in\\nthe house now. Josh filled my flask well the last time.”\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode had not yet fully learned that even the desire for cognac\\nwas not stronger in Raffles than the desire to torment, and that a hint\\nof annoyance always served him as a fresh cue. But it was at least\\nclear that further objection was useless, and Mr. Bulstrode, in giving\\norders to the housekeeper for the accommodation of the guest, had a\\nresolute air of quietude.\\n\\nThere was the comfort of thinking that this housekeeper had been in the\\nservice of Rigg also, and might accept the idea that Mr. Bulstrode\\nentertained Raffles merely as a friend of her former master.\\n\\nWhen there was food and drink spread before his visitor in the\\nwainscoted parlor, and no witness in the room, Mr. Bulstrode said—\\n\\n“Your habits and mine are so different, Mr. Raffles, that we can hardly\\nenjoy each other’s society. The wisest plan for both of us will\\ntherefore be to part as soon as possible. Since you say that you wished\\nto meet me, you probably considered that you had some business to\\ntransact with me. But under the circumstances I will invite you to\\nremain here for the night, and I will myself ride over here early\\nto-morrow morning—before breakfast, in fact—when I can receive any\\ncommunication you have to make to me.”\\n\\n“With all my heart,” said Raffles; “this is a comfortable place—a\\nlittle dull for a continuance; but I can put up with it for a night,\\nwith this good liquor and the prospect of seeing you again in the\\nmorning. You’re a much better host than my stepson was; but Josh owed\\nme a bit of a grudge for marrying his mother; and between you and me\\nthere was never anything but kindness.”\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode, hoping that the peculiar mixture of joviality and\\nsneering in Raffles’ manner was a good deal the effect of drink, had\\ndetermined to wait till he was quite sober before he spent more words\\nupon him. But he rode home with a terribly lucid vision of the\\ndifficulty there would be in arranging any result that could be\\npermanently counted on with this man. It was inevitable that he should\\nwish to get rid of John Raffles, though his reappearance could not be\\nregarded as lying outside the divine plan. The spirit of evil might\\nhave sent him to threaten Mr. Bulstrode’s subversion as an instrument\\nof good; but the threat must have been permitted, and was a\\nchastisement of a new kind. It was an hour of anguish for him very\\ndifferent from the hours in which his struggle had been securely\\nprivate, and which had ended with a sense that his secret misdeeds were\\npardoned and his services accepted. Those misdeeds even when\\ncommitted—had they not been half sanctified by the singleness of his\\ndesire to devote himself and all he possessed to the furtherance of the\\ndivine scheme? And was he after all to become a mere stone of stumbling\\nand a rock of offence? For who would understand the work within him?\\nWho would not, when there was the pretext of casting disgrace upon him,\\nconfound his whole life and the truths he had espoused, in one heap of\\nobloquy?\\n\\nIn his closest meditations the life-long habit of Mr. Bulstrode’s mind\\nclad his most egoistic terrors in doctrinal references to superhuman\\nends. But even while we are talking and meditating about the earth’s\\norbit and the solar system, what we feel and adjust our movements to is\\nthe stable earth and the changing day. And now within all the automatic\\nsuccession of theoretic phrases—distinct and inmost as the shiver and\\nthe ache of oncoming fever when we are discussing abstract pain, was\\nthe forecast of disgrace in the presence of his neighbors and of his\\nown wife. For the pain, as well as the public estimate of disgrace,\\ndepends on the amount of previous profession. To men who only aim at\\nescaping felony, nothing short of the prisoner’s dock is disgrace. But\\nMr. Bulstrode had aimed at being an eminent Christian.\\n\\nIt was not more than half-past seven in the morning when he again\\nreached Stone Court. The fine old place never looked more like a\\ndelightful home than at that moment; the great white lilies were in\\nflower, the nasturtiums, their pretty leaves all silvered with dew,\\nwere running away over the low stone wall; the very noises all around\\nhad a heart of peace within them. But everything was spoiled for the\\nowner as he walked on the gravel in front and awaited the descent of\\nMr. Raffles, with whom he was condemned to breakfast.\\n\\nIt was not long before they were seated together in the wainscoted\\nparlor over their tea and toast, which was as much as Raffles cared to\\ntake at that early hour. The difference between his morning and evening\\nself was not so great as his companion had imagined that it might be;\\nthe delight in tormenting was perhaps even the stronger because his\\nspirits were rather less highly pitched. Certainly his manners seemed\\nmore disagreeable by the morning light.\\n\\n“As I have little time to spare, Mr. Raffles,” said the banker, who\\ncould hardly do more than sip his tea and break his toast without\\neating it, “I shall be obliged if you will mention at once the ground\\non which you wished to meet with me. I presume that you have a home\\nelsewhere and will be glad to return to it.”\\n\\n“Why, if a man has got any heart, doesn’t he want to see an old friend,\\nNick?—I must call you Nick—we always did call you young Nick when we\\nknew you meant to marry the old widow. Some said you had a handsome\\nfamily likeness to old Nick, but that was your mother’s fault, calling\\nyou Nicholas. Aren’t you glad to see me again? I expected an invite to\\nstay with you at some pretty place. My own establishment is broken up\\nnow my wife’s dead. I’ve no particular attachment to any spot; I would\\nas soon settle hereabout as anywhere.”\\n\\n“May I ask why you returned from America? I considered that the strong\\nwish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was\\ntantamount to an engagement that you would remain there for life.”\\n\\n“Never knew that a wish to go to a place was the same thing as a wish\\nto stay. But I did stay a matter of ten years; it didn’t suit me to\\nstay any longer. And I’m not going again, Nick.” Here Mr. Raffles\\nwinked slowly as he looked at Mr. Bulstrode.\\n\\n“Do you wish to be settled in any business? What is your calling now?”\\n\\n“Thank you, my calling is to enjoy myself as much as I can. I don’t\\ncare about working any more. If I did anything it would be a little\\ntravelling in the tobacco line—or something of that sort, which takes a\\nman into agreeable company. But not without an independence to fall\\nback upon. That’s what I want: I’m not so strong as I was, Nick, though\\nI’ve got more color than you. I want an independence.”\\n\\n“That could be supplied to you, if you would engage to keep at a\\ndistance,” said Mr. Bulstrode, perhaps with a little too much eagerness\\nin his undertone.\\n\\n“That must be as it suits my convenience,” said Raffles coolly. “I see\\nno reason why I shouldn’t make a few acquaintances hereabout. I’m not\\nashamed of myself as company for anybody. I dropped my portmanteau at\\nthe turnpike when I got down—change of linen—genuine—honor bright—more\\nthan fronts and wristbands; and with this suit of mourning, straps and\\neverything, I should do you credit among the nobs here.” Mr. Raffles\\nhad pushed away his chair and looked down at himself, particularly at\\nhis straps. His chief intention was to annoy Bulstrode, but he really\\nthought that his appearance now would produce a good effect, and that\\nhe was not only handsome and witty, but clad in a mourning style which\\nimplied solid connections.\\n\\n“If you intend to rely on me in any way, Mr. Raffles,” said Bulstrode,\\nafter a moment’s pause, “you will expect to meet my wishes.”\\n\\n“Ah, to be sure,” said Raffles, with a mocking cordiality. “Didn’t I\\nalways do it? Lord, you made a pretty thing out of me, and I got but\\nlittle. I’ve often thought since, I might have done better by telling\\nthe old woman that I’d found her daughter and her grandchild: it would\\nhave suited my feelings better; I’ve got a soft place in my heart. But\\nyou’ve buried the old lady by this time, I suppose—it’s all one to her\\nnow. And you’ve got your fortune out of that profitable business which\\nhad such a blessing on it. You’ve taken to being a nob, buying land,\\nbeing a country bashaw. Still in the Dissenting line, eh? Still godly?\\nOr taken to the Church as more genteel?”\\n\\nThis time Mr. Raffles’ slow wink and slight protrusion of his tongue\\nwas worse than a nightmare, because it held the certitude that it was\\nnot a nightmare, but a waking misery. Mr. Bulstrode felt a shuddering\\nnausea, and did not speak, but was considering diligently whether he\\nshould not leave Raffles to do as he would, and simply defy him as a\\nslanderer. The man would soon show himself disreputable enough to make\\npeople disbelieve him. “But not when he tells any ugly-looking truth\\nabout _you_,” said discerning consciousness. And again: it seemed no\\nwrong to keep Raffles at a distance, but Mr. Bulstrode shrank from the\\ndirect falsehood of denying true statements. It was one thing to look\\nback on forgiven sins, nay, to explain questionable conformity to lax\\ncustoms, and another to enter deliberately on the necessity of\\nfalsehood.\\n\\nBut since Bulstrode did not speak, Raffles ran on, by way of using time\\nto the utmost.\\n\\n“I’ve not had such fine luck as you, by Jove! Things went confoundedly\\nwith me in New York; those Yankees are cool hands, and a man of\\ngentlemanly feelings has no chance with them. I married when I came\\nback—a nice woman in the tobacco trade—very fond of me—but the trade\\nwas restricted, as we say. She had been settled there a good many years\\nby a friend; but there was a son too much in the case. Josh and I never\\nhit it off. However, I made the most of the position, and I’ve always\\ntaken my glass in good company. It’s been all on the square with me;\\nI’m as open as the day. You won’t take it ill of me that I didn’t look\\nyou up before. I’ve got a complaint that makes me a little dilatory. I\\nthought you were trading and praying away in London still, and didn’t\\nfind you there. But you see I was sent to you, Nick—perhaps for a\\nblessing to both of us.”\\n\\nMr. Raffles ended with a jocose snuffle: no man felt his intellect more\\nsuperior to religious cant. And if the cunning which calculates on the\\nmeanest feelings in men could be called intellect, he had his share,\\nfor under the blurting rallying tone with which he spoke to Bulstrode,\\nthere was an evident selection of statements, as if they had been so\\nmany moves at chess. Meanwhile Bulstrode had determined on his move,\\nand he said, with gathered resolution—\\n\\n“You will do well to reflect, Mr. Raffles, that it is possible for a\\nman to overreach himself in the effort to secure undue advantage.\\nAlthough I am not in any way bound to you, I am willing to supply you\\nwith a regular annuity—in quarterly payments—so long as you fulfil a\\npromise to remain at a distance from this neighborhood. It is in your\\npower to choose. If you insist on remaining here, even for a short\\ntime, you will get nothing from me. I shall decline to know you.”\\n\\n“Ha, ha!” said Raffles, with an affected explosion, “that reminds me of\\na droll dog of a thief who declined to know the constable.”\\n\\n“Your allusions are lost on me sir,” said Bulstrode, with white heat;\\n“the law has no hold on me either through your agency or any other.”\\n\\n“You can’t understand a joke, my good fellow. I only meant that I\\nshould never decline to know you. But let us be serious. Your quarterly\\npayment won’t quite suit me. I like my freedom.”\\n\\nHere Raffles rose and stalked once or twice up and down the room,\\nswinging his leg, and assuming an air of masterly meditation. At last\\nhe stopped opposite Bulstrode, and said, “I’ll tell you what! Give us a\\ncouple of hundreds—come, that’s modest—and I’ll go away—honor\\nbright!—pick up my portmanteau and go away. But I shall not give up my\\nliberty for a dirty annuity. I shall come and go where I like. Perhaps\\nit may suit me to stay away, and correspond with a friend; perhaps not.\\nHave you the money with you?”\\n\\n“No, I have one hundred,” said Bulstrode, feeling the immediate\\nriddance too great a relief to be rejected on the ground of future\\nuncertainties. “I will forward you the other if you will mention an\\naddress.”\\n\\n“No, I’ll wait here till you bring it,” said Raffles. “I’ll take a\\nstroll and have a snack, and you’ll be back by that time.”\\n\\nMr. Bulstrode’s sickly body, shattered by the agitations he had gone\\nthrough since the last evening, made him feel abjectly in the power of\\nthis loud invulnerable man. At that moment he snatched at a temporary\\nrepose to be won on any terms. He was rising to do what Raffles\\nsuggested, when the latter said, lifting up his finger as if with a\\nsudden recollection—\\n\\n“I did have another look after Sarah again, though I didn’t tell you;\\nI’d a tender conscience about that pretty young woman. I didn’t find\\nher, but I found out her husband’s name, and I made a note of it. But\\nhang it, I lost my pocketbook. However, if I heard it, I should know it\\nagain. I’ve got my faculties as if I was in my prime, but names wear\\nout, by Jove! Sometimes I’m no better than a confounded tax-paper\\nbefore the names are filled in. However, if I hear of her and her\\nfamily, you shall know, Nick. You’d like to do something for her, now\\nshe’s your step-daughter.”\\n\\n“Doubtless,” said Mr. Bulstrode, with the usual steady look of his\\nlight-gray eyes; “though that might reduce my power of assisting you.”\\n\\nAs he walked out of the room, Raffles winked slowly at his back, and\\nthen turned towards the window to watch the banker riding\\naway—virtually at his command. His lips first curled with a smile and\\nthen opened with a short triumphant laugh.\\n\\n“But what the deuce was the name?” he presently said, half aloud,\\nscratching his head, and wrinkling his brows horizontally. He had not\\nreally cared or thought about this point of forgetfulness until it\\noccurred to him in his invention of annoyances for Bulstrode.\\n\\n“It began with L; it was almost all l’s I fancy,” he went on, with a\\nsense that he was getting hold of the slippery name. But the hold was\\ntoo slight, and he soon got tired of this mental chase; for few men\\nwere more impatient of private occupation or more in need of making\\nthemselves continually heard than Mr. Raffles. He preferred using his\\ntime in pleasant conversation with the bailiff and the housekeeper,\\nfrom whom he gathered as much as he wanted to know about Mr.\\nBulstrode’s position in Middlemarch.\\n\\nAfter all, however, there was a dull space of time which needed\\nrelieving with bread and cheese and ale, and when he was seated alone\\nwith these resources in the wainscoted parlor, he suddenly slapped his\\nknee, and exclaimed, “Ladislaw!” That action of memory which he had\\ntried to set going, and had abandoned in despair, had suddenly\\ncompleted itself without conscious effort—a common experience,\\nagreeable as a completed sneeze, even if the name remembered is of no\\nvalue. Raffles immediately took out his pocket-book, and wrote down the\\nname, not because he expected to use it, but merely for the sake of not\\nbeing at a loss if he ever did happen to want it. He was not going to\\ntell Bulstrode: there was no actual good in telling, and to a mind like\\nthat of Mr. Raffles there is always probable good in a secret.\\n\\nHe was satisfied with his present success, and by three o’clock that\\nday he had taken up his portmanteau at the turnpike and mounted the\\ncoach, relieving Mr. Bulstrode’s eyes of an ugly black spot on the\\nlandscape at Stone Court, but not relieving him of the dread that the\\nblack spot might reappear and become inseparable even from the vision\\nof his hearth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBOOK VI.\\nTHE WIDOW AND THE WIFE.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER LIV.\\n\\n“Negli occhi porta la mia donna Amore;\\nPer che si fa gentil ciò ch’ella mira:\\nOv’ella passa, ogni uom ver lei si gira,\\nE cui saluta fa tremar lo core.\\n\\nSicchè, bassando il viso, tutto smore,\\nE d’ogni suo difetto allor sospira:\\nFuggon dinanzi a lei Superbia ed Ira:\\nAiutatemi, donne, a farle onore.\\n\\nOgni dolcezza, ogni pensiero umile\\nNasce nel core a chi parlar la sente;\\nOnd’è beato chi prima la vide.\\nQuel ch’ella par quand’ un poco sorride,\\nNon si può dicer, nè tener a mente,\\nSi è nuovo miracolo gentile.”\\n—DANTE: _La Vita Nuova_.\\n\\n\\nBy that delightful morning when the hay-ricks at Stone Court were\\nscenting the air quite impartially, as if Mr. Raffles had been a guest\\nworthy of finest incense, Dorothea had again taken up her abode at\\nLowick Manor. After three months Freshitt had become rather oppressive:\\nto sit like a model for Saint Catherine looking rapturously at Celia’s\\nbaby would not do for many hours in the day, and to remain in that\\nmomentous babe’s presence with persistent disregard was a course that\\ncould not have been tolerated in a childless sister. Dorothea would\\nhave been capable of carrying baby joyfully for a mile if there had\\nbeen need, and of loving it the more tenderly for that labor; but to an\\naunt who does not recognize her infant nephew as Bouddha, and has\\nnothing to do for him but to admire, his behavior is apt to appear\\nmonotonous, and the interest of watching him exhaustible. This\\npossibility was quite hidden from Celia, who felt that Dorothea’s\\nchildless widowhood fell in quite prettily with the birth of little\\nArthur (baby was named after Mr. Brooke).\\n\\n“Dodo is just the creature not to mind about having anything of her\\nown—children or anything!” said Celia to her husband. “And if she had\\nhad a baby, it never could have been such a dear as Arthur. Could it,\\nJames?\\n\\n“Not if it had been like Casaubon,” said Sir James, conscious of some\\nindirectness in his answer, and of holding a strictly private opinion\\nas to the perfections of his first-born.\\n\\n“No! just imagine! Really it was a mercy,” said Celia; “and I think it\\nis very nice for Dodo to be a widow. She can be just as fond of our\\nbaby as if it were her own, and she can have as many notions of her own\\nas she likes.”\\n\\n“It is a pity she was not a queen,” said the devout Sir James.\\n\\n“But what should we have been then? We must have been something else,”\\nsaid Celia, objecting to so laborious a flight of imagination. “I like\\nher better as she is.”\\n\\nHence, when she found that Dorothea was making arrangements for her\\nfinal departure to Lowick, Celia raised her eyebrows with\\ndisappointment, and in her quiet unemphatic way shot a needle-arrow of\\nsarcasm.\\n\\n“What will you do at Lowick, Dodo? You say yourself there is nothing to\\nbe done there: everybody is so clean and well off, it makes you quite\\nmelancholy. And here you have been so happy going all about Tipton with\\nMr. Garth into the worst backyards. And now uncle is abroad, you and\\nMr. Garth can have it all your own way; and I am sure James does\\neverything you tell him.”\\n\\n“I shall often come here, and I shall see how baby grows all the\\nbetter,” said Dorothea.\\n\\n“But you will never see him washed,” said Celia; “and that is quite the\\nbest part of the day.” She was almost pouting: it did seem to her very\\nhard in Dodo to go away from the baby when she might stay.\\n\\n“Dear Kitty, I will come and stay all night on purpose,” said Dorothea;\\n“but I want to be alone now, and in my own home. I wish to know the\\nFarebrothers better, and to talk to Mr. Farebrother about what there is\\nto be done in Middlemarch.”\\n\\nDorothea’s native strength of will was no longer all converted into\\nresolute submission. She had a great yearning to be at Lowick, and was\\nsimply determined to go, not feeling bound to tell all her reasons. But\\nevery one around her disapproved. Sir James was much pained, and\\noffered that they should all migrate to Cheltenham for a few months\\nwith the sacred ark, otherwise called a cradle: at that period a man\\ncould hardly know what to propose if Cheltenham were rejected.\\n\\nThe Dowager Lady Chettam, just returned from a visit to her daughter in\\ntown, wished, at least, that Mrs. Vigo should be written to, and\\ninvited to accept the office of companion to Mrs. Casaubon: it was not\\ncredible that Dorothea as a young widow would think of living alone in\\nthe house at Lowick. Mrs. Vigo had been reader and secretary to royal\\npersonages, and in point of knowledge and sentiments even Dorothea\\ncould have nothing to object to her.\\n\\nMrs. Cadwallader said, privately, “You will certainly go mad in that\\nhouse alone, my dear. You will see visions. We have all got to exert\\nourselves a little to keep sane, and call things by the same names as\\nother people call them by. To be sure, for younger sons and women who\\nhave no money, it is a sort of provision to go mad: they are taken care\\nof then. But you must not run into that. I dare say you are a little\\nbored here with our good dowager; but think what a bore you might\\nbecome yourself to your fellow-creatures if you were always playing\\ntragedy queen and taking things sublimely. Sitting alone in that\\nlibrary at Lowick you may fancy yourself ruling the weather; you must\\nget a few people round you who wouldn’t believe you if you told them.\\nThat is a good lowering medicine.”\\n\\n“I never called everything by the same name that all the people about\\nme did,” said Dorothea, stoutly.\\n\\n“But I suppose you have found out your mistake, my dear,” said Mrs.\\nCadwallader, “and that is a proof of sanity.”\\n\\nDorothea was aware of the sting, but it did not hurt her. “No,” she\\nsaid, “I still think that the greater part of the world is mistaken\\nabout many things. Surely one may be sane and yet think so, since the\\ngreater part of the world has often had to come round from its\\nopinion.”\\n\\nMrs. Cadwallader said no more on that point to Dorothea, but to her\\nhusband she remarked, “It will be well for her to marry again as soon\\nas it is proper, if one could get her among the right people. Of course\\nthe Chettams would not wish it. But I see clearly a husband is the best\\nthing to keep her in order. If we were not so poor I would invite Lord\\nTriton. He will be marquis some day, and there is no denying that she\\nwould make a good marchioness: she looks handsomer than ever in her\\nmourning.”\\n\\n“My dear Elinor, do let the poor woman alone. Such contrivances are of\\nno use,” said the easy Rector.\\n\\n“No use? How are matches made, except by bringing men and women\\ntogether? And it is a shame that her uncle should have run away and\\nshut up the Grange just now. There ought to be plenty of eligible\\nmatches invited to Freshitt and the Grange. Lord Triton is precisely\\nthe man: full of plans for making the people happy in a soft-headed\\nsort of way. That would just suit Mrs. Casaubon.”\\n\\n“Let Mrs. Casaubon choose for herself, Elinor.”\\n\\n“That is the nonsense you wise men talk! How can she choose if she has\\nno variety to choose from? A woman’s choice usually means taking the\\nonly man she can get. Mark my words, Humphrey. If her friends don’t\\nexert themselves, there will be a worse business than the Casaubon\\nbusiness yet.”\\n\\n“For heaven’s sake don’t touch on that topic, Elinor! It is a very sore\\npoint with Sir James. He would be deeply offended if you entered on it\\nto him unnecessarily.”\\n\\n“I have never entered on it,” said Mrs Cadwallader, opening her hands.\\n“Celia told me all about the will at the beginning, without any asking\\nof mine.”\\n\\n“Yes, yes; but they want the thing hushed up, and I understand that the\\nyoung fellow is going out of the neighborhood.”\\n\\nMrs. Cadwallader said nothing, but gave her husband three significant\\nnods, with a very sarcastic expression in her dark eyes.\\n\\nDorothea quietly persisted in spite of remonstrance and persuasion. So\\nby the end of June the shutters were all opened at Lowick Manor, and\\nthe morning gazed calmly into the library, shining on the rows of\\nnote-books as it shines on the weary waste planted with huge stones,\\nthe mute memorial of a forgotten faith; and the evening laden with\\nroses entered silently into the blue-green boudoir where Dorothea chose\\noftenest to sit. At first she walked into every room, questioning the\\neighteen months of her married life, and carrying on her thoughts as if\\nthey were a speech to be heard by her husband. Then, she lingered in\\nthe library and could not be at rest till she had carefully ranged all\\nthe note-books as she imagined that he would wish to see them, in\\norderly sequence. The pity which had been the restraining compelling\\nmotive in her life with him still clung about his image, even while she\\nremonstrated with him in indignant thought and told him that he was\\nunjust. One little act of hers may perhaps be smiled at as\\nsuperstitious. The Synoptical Tabulation for the use of Mrs. Casaubon,\\nshe carefully enclosed and sealed, writing within the envelope, “I\\ncould not use it. Do you not see now that I could not submit my soul to\\nyours, by working hopelessly at what I have no belief in—Dorothea?”\\nThen she deposited the paper in her own desk.\\n\\nThat silent colloquy was perhaps only the more earnest because\\nunderneath and through it all there was always the deep longing which\\nhad really determined her to come to Lowick.
